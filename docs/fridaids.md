# /aids/ Theme Event Fridays
{: .center}

Sorted in **descending** order of recency, this is a log of all of the theme Friday submissions, starting from mid May 2021. There was [a previous one](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-Fridays.html), but it seems to be kill, so I've created this one as a fresh start.
{: .center}

## Rules

- A link to your prompt must posted in the thread.
  - Said link must be to prompts.aidg.club.
- Your submission must be posted as a reply to an anchor post made **on or near to the Friday** of the event.
  - An image is optional, though recommended. Not for any particular reason, other than it makes my job ~~easier~~ harder it makes it harder. But at least your prompt will be more eye-catching?
- Please at least try.
- ~~Explore link is optional as well.~~ Well, we certainly aren't doing that anymore.

## The Friday of *Touhou Project*
{: .center}

Let's make prompts about a bullet hell game series created by an alcoholic that has become a content megalith due to permissive licencing, endearing characters, good music, and doujin culture.

***What's Touhou?***

>*To his surprise, what emerged out of the eldritch rift was not an equally eldritch monster, but the top half of a woman dressed in flashy purple clothing, smiling at him with a veneer of innocence. Having long blond hair and ample features that her outfit struggled to hide, this woman of exceptional beauty had an undeniable sense of maturity around her. The smiling lady lifted herself out, her legs crossed as she sat in the air with a parasol twirling in her delicate hands.*
>
>*Primeval instincts screamed within Rintaro, warning of the aberration in the shape of a human girl. In an instant, he clambered back only to press against the wall directly behind him.*
>
>*His antics seemed to only amuse her. "Pleased to meet you, my name is Yukari Yakumo," she introduced herself nonchalantly.*

Yukari is up to no good again, this time she's thinking with portals.

### *Ran's Deal*

>*Ran watches with amusement before responding, "Look at you two go, how cute. Ah, but..." she stands and looks over to the window, which has transitioned from a summery orange into a dark violet, "It's getting late, is it not? Already time for you to be in bed."*
>
>*Chen immediately protests, crossing her arms behind her head defiantly. "Nah! I'm having fun with the human, and we're not going to bed!"*
>
>*The big, gentle looking kitsune shakes her head with a sigh. "Now listen here, little Chen," Ran says in her soft voice, her tone serious, but with a hint of a caring mother-like quality underneath it all. "It's already been settled. This is your bedtime, and so you should be getting to sleep!"*
>
>*"Aw..."*
>
>*Chen gives a lip-quivering moue at this interruption. She glances my way, considering her options, and then dejectedly shuffles past me to retreat to her room. I also stand up, and start walking to my own room when...*
>
>*"Ah, human, please, wait a second," Ran calls out, interrupting my departure as she closes the door to Chen's room, turning back to face me. "I think there's something we need to discuss before your bedtime, yeah?"*

Another friendly evening with Chen must have pushed Ran over the edge. Guess you're gonna have to stay up past your bedtime to hear what this nine-tailed hag has to say.

(You are not going to be getting to bed by bedtime)

### *Never Played It*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4340>*
{: .center}

![img](https://files.catbox.moe/azflfx.png)
{: .center}

>*"OK, and why exactly do you need to record me beating the game?" I ask him, still confused.*
>
>*Well, that question seems to have cut right to the heart of the matter, and Takuro's face turns bright red with embarrassment. "Um... I need footage of, well, 'me' beating the game to prove to people online that I beat the game to prove my, er, gamer cred. Please, you got to help me, I can't afford being exposed as a poser!" he begs, and lord, does he seem desperate. Indeed, before I can even respond, his expression gains a certain... glint. "Please, Flynn... I'd do anything..."*
>
>*Whoa, where's this coming from? Did he learn this from some sort of pervy Japanese cartoon or something? "What do you mean, anything?" I ask in return, suddenly feeling a strange combination of concerned... and curious.*

One of my friends is very heavily into a series of magical anime girl shooter games, but one day, he admits to me that while he composes remixed music based on the games' soundtracks and makes art based on the games' characters, he's never actually played them, apparently intimidated by their difficulty. Instead, he begs me to play them for him, and he tells me he'd do anything if I did that in a way that's way too suggestive to be an accident. What have I gotten myself into?

### *Reimu Hakurei-pistu*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4341>*
{: .center}

>*It wasn't even mid-day and already the grounds of the Hakurei shrine were filled with the grumbling and half-spoken curses of its lone shrine maiden. For the sixth time this week, Reimu had to clean her bedding. That stupid new penis of hers just wouldn't stop leaking!*
>
>*"I swear, if I find who did this to me, they'll be in a world of pain..."*

Let's say, hypothetically speaking, someone has drugged the shrine's water supply for a month now, lacing it with futanium or something. Let's then also assume that Reimu, while suffering the effects had been kept so busy she had no time to ever relief her new appendage in any meaningful way.


### *Gapped*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4342>*
{: .center}

![img](https://files.catbox.moe/8cvdg2.jpg)
{: .center}

>*"So if there's a universe out there where Touhou is real, where Yukari Yakumo exists, that means that she could totally manipulate the boundary between that universe and ours! She could totally exist and be out there! Show up any moment! Ah, just the thought is so exciting, isn't it?"*
>
>*His gaze ablaze he pumps his fist and looks at me.*
>
>*"You really don't get it, huh? She could show up here and take us to Gensokyo! Right now! We just have to believe in her! Those youkai need people to believe in them to exist after all. Something like that."*
>
>*Now he's gone totally crazy, hasn't he? I can only shake my head.*
>
>*"Bro. Calm down. Calm down! There's no way some anime girl would just show up here, no matter how powerful she is in the story. It's not real, my man."*
>
>*Just then, a weird feeling of vertigo overcomes me. It's as if my feet have lost contact with the ground. My eyes widening, I look down at the ground. Where the garish carpet of my friend's apartment had been was now some weird purple hole full of creepy red eyes, tied off with ribbons on each end. Before I can react, I begin to fall straight into it, my friend launching himself at me and planting his belly on the table, unable to reach me before everything goes dark.*
>
>*The last thing I hear is a drawn-out scream of frustration from my friend who was clearly staying behind and not currently falling into some weird space.*
>
>*"So unfair! Take me instead!"*

Something unexpected happens when your best friend starts going off on another boring rant about how great that Touhou thing is.

### *All for the sake of the Hakurei shrine...right?*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4343>*
{: .center}

![img](https://files.catbox.moe/kyncza.jpg)
{: .center}

>*The wealthy degenerate proved the greed-struck shrine maiden wrong, of course. So for several weeks Jay would pay to watch Reimu perform some duties with her bosom on full display. Thanks to all the 'donations' she had earned this way, Reimu was able to perform a lot of important repairs to the shrine.*
>
>*Then, he wanted to actually grope her! That went way too far, at least from where they started. Looking was one thing, but touching? That was too much... or not valued high enough by Jay.*
>
>*Eventually Jay got his way and managed to enjoy the sensation of cupping Reimu's breasts in his hands, with some hand-shaped bruises across his face when he pinched her nipples without warning, but the guy didn't seem to mind; in fact he seemed to like it, and paid extra.*
>
>*The shrine maiden was drawn from her reverie as Jay cleared his throat, pushing an open coffer filled with money towards the impoverished girl. "One million yen," Jay said in his calm, measured tone. His flushed cheeks betrayed his arousal, however.*
>
>*"And in exchange you want to do...what, exactly?"*

Imagine being a rich schmuck with a desire to do terrible things to Reimu. Imagine your surprise when she'll flash you her tits for a tootsie roll. What would some actual dosh do, you wonder? Well...

### *Fortune Teller's Fortune Retold*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4345>*
{: .center}

>*Reimu Hakurei, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, stands before me poised to exterminate me without remorse. She has refused to listen to reason, and thus I have little choice but to defend myself. What she does not know, however, is that I am one of the only male characters in all of Touhou, and thus all of the masculinity that should have been diffused throughout a large cast is instead flowing through my veins like raw power! Piercing lightless voids that were once eyes gaze at the shrine maiden before me. The darkness of my presence parts like a fine mist as I descend from my place floating just above the ground, touching the ground with the tip of my feet and throwing my arms wide.*
>
>*"Come, Reimu Hakurei! Let me show you the power of the Cock!" I roar in challenge.*

Once, one of the only male characters in all of Touhou found himself wrongfully struck down by the dreaded Hakurei Reimu, merciless hound of the status quo. But what if things played had out differently? What if this innocent man stopped holding back, and unleashed the true power of Cock? Fight for freedom through this nightmare, or tread the harsh path to true peace. No matter what, the adventure of Fortune Teller begins now with a bang!

### *Phantasmagoria of Hag Heaven*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4346>*
{: .center}

>*With my long labor over, I was free to lean back and observe my handiwork. It had been a difficult thing, installing many of the commodities here in a place so archaic as Gensokyo, but with the right capital and kappa industry it seemed anything was possible. Once a humble inn in the Human Village, this sprawling establishment had been converted into a composite bar, strip club,onsen, and amusement park. Named âHag Heavenâ for what I intended to use it for, Iâd finally come upon the eve of my long standing dream; to live my life in the lap of luxury, or more accurately in the lap of mature older youkai.*

A lunatic with the power to manipulate older women and too much money to spare decides to create a place where hags can be hags. His hags, that is.

### *Incident of Celestial Hag Correction*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4347>*
{: .center}

>*As a Celestial, my life was one of pleasant and dreamlike amusement, fluttering about from one enjoyment to the next, but recently another of my ilk, the fool named Tenshi, had caused troubles for the land of Gensokyo below. Far from reprimanding her, all proceeded as usual, and I myself grew interested in interfering in my own way once her incident had been resolved. Standing up on my cloudy perch far above the crust of the Earth, I held in my hand a stolen treasure of Heaven, the Rod of Hag Correction. With this artifact I will cause my own incident in Gensokyo, by targeting its oldest and most powerful youkai and using the Rod to correct their behavior to suit my desires. With a mere thought I compel the clouds beneath my feet to carry me to my destination, another spot in the sky where one such hag awaits.*

Emboldened by Tenshi's shenanigans, a bored Celestial steals a heavenly artifact and decides to correct some of Gensokyo's hags.

### *Jack Garland wanders into Gensokyo*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4348>*
{: .center}

>*The gentle rustling of leaves mingled in the cool breeze with the innocent laughter of fairies that was carried upon it. The Earth and woods around abounded with green, both life and light in visible abundance. Gentle canopies of shade and streams of light alike mingled in a serene and thoughtful dance between the treetops, and the gnarled roots of ancient trees poked up from the land like the waves of an ocean frozen still in time. All was peaceful, all was beautiful. This land where the fantastic lived in peace with the world was known as Gensokyo.*
>
>*âCHAOS is here, I can feel him!â a lone madman snarled to the voices in his head.*

Like the start to a bad joke.

### *Do Your Best Kogasa-san!*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4349>*
{: .center}

![img](https://files.catbox.moe/k9fkha.png)
{: .center}

>*The rather conspicuous youkai was given a wide berth by the villagers she passedânot necessarily out of fear. As a karakasa, she fed off the fright and surprise of humans, and her antics had made her quite notorious among the locals. Most viewed her as a persistent, but harmless nuisance; a general annoyance, but not run out of town yet. Her results had been particularly discouraging lately, thoughâeven the children had grown used to her tactics.*
>
>*Her morning had been spent on a fruitless search for prey, and as noon arrived she took a moment to rest beside a teahouse. Even as Kogasa took a bite out of a discarded teacake, the hunger for the startled spirit of a victim didn't subside at all. Groaning, she turned to her side. "People just don't fear youkai like they used to, you know?"*

A story about a bothersome umbrella.

## The Friday of *Royalty and Nobility*

Let's make prompts about high society, and the rampant blue-blooded brown-nosing therein.

{: .center}

### *Lady Mia's Self-Made Downfall*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4289>*
{: .center}

>*Mia realized her father would murder Randy if he took her first time. She couldn't bear the thought of having him die for her freedom, not when she loved him with all her heart. She needed a plan, something that wouldn't endanger his life too much. Perhaps she shouldn't let Randy have her first time... No matter how much she wanted to stay loyal, she must lay with other men until she was cast out from nobility. 'No matter' she realized, as virginity was a concept that only mattered to nobles... Right?*
>
>*Mia decided that the only way to protect Randy was to act like a whore. She would have sex with anyone who asked, and show no shame or regret afterward. If her reputation became sullied enough, her father might see her unfit for marriage and toss her aside. She would become a commoner, and live her life with Randy forevermore!*

Lady Mia publically degrades herself in pursuit of happiness.

### *A Royal Pain*

>*And so, Senna was burdened with a desire no man would indulge her, a hunger she could never sateâor at least, that was what she had thought, until providence had seen fit to tempt her with an opportunity, one the Princess had seized upon without hesitation.*
>
>*After a lifetime of loyal serviceâand discretionâthe Castle's torturer had passed away, leaving his post vacant. Finding none of adequate cruelty among the guard with which to replace him, the King had sought a skilled replacement from beyond his bordersâand found one, in the form of a disgraced soldier by the name of Edward Carrow. Now he was to serve as the new master of the same dungeon Senna now hurried through, a stolen key clutched tightly to her laced bodice.*

A princess with a depraved secret disguises herself as a peasant to indulge in her masochistic fantasies.

>*"No, no, that simply won't do. Try again."*
>
>*"Pardon?" James asked, feeling his face grow red with his rising temper. "I'm afraid I don't quite understand."*
>
>*"Go out, and come back inside as would befit the head of my servants. I can't stand to look at you without the proper show of respect," the princess cooed, waving James away with a lazy motion of her hand. The brat couldn't even keep a straight face, as her polite frown turned into a cruel, self-satisfied smirk.*
>
>*With a hasty bow, and trembling fists, James hurried out of the room, shut the door and paused for a few breaths before knocking on the door.*
>
>*"You may come inside," the princess announced. James re-entered the brat's bed chamber and bowed, far too deep to seem proper, before stepping beside her.*
>
>*James felt the heat of his face rise as he took in the smug expression the princess regarded him with.*
>
>*"See? That's much better. Was it really so hard to show a princess the proper amount of respect? Tsk tsk, I thought I'd taught you better by now, Jimmy," Leonora hummed. The amount of gloating she put into those words was only overshone by the radiant smugness of her sickening smile.*
>
>*Something snapped inside of James at that moment. Decades of servitude and humility could not help to quell the rage that had festered and broiled inside of him ever since he had been put in charge of this demon of a princess.*
>
>*James's polite mask of a servant crumbled, revealing the enraged and almost mad visage that had hidden underneath.*

What happens when you're the sole caretaker to a sickly and demanding young prince(ss)?

Put simply: correction of their attitude.

### *A New Style of Harem*
{: .center}

*<https://aetherroom.club/4288>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/t6f1fp.png)
{: .center}

>*This, of course, allows for me to further pursue my policies of liberalization, which doesn't just involve passing new laws and voiding tyrannical old ones, but also some additional changes that involve the palace and its denizens. Over the last few months, my soldiers have been scouring the world, searching for people to join my new harem. But not women. My new harem consists exclusively of men, to further distance myself from my father's reign. A dozen men, from all over the world, now live at my palace. They are paid very well and given great freedom within the palace grounds, with them basically having free reign over the place, full command of my servants, and the right to disobey me if they so choose. Something like this is completely unprecedented and could end in disaster, but so far, things have gone quite well. Despite my harem now being twelve men from all over the world that have total freedom, they ultimately do what I ask them to most of the time, not out of obedience, but out of friendship.*

After taking over as the king of Al-Larian after the death of my tyrannical father, I seek to show the realm that things will be different now, more moderate, more tolerant. And to lead by example, I have freed all the women of my father's old harem, replacing them with a dozen of handsome men that are paid well and given great freedoms. I find that giving freedom and opportunity for consent makes the intimacy that much more enjoyable...

### *The Wild's New Garb*

{: .center}

>*Fighting to keep her face impassive, Zariqua eyed the loom where the weavers were currently putting the finishing touches on her attire. Supposedly, anyway. All she could see was the device as the hyenas mimed the movements of weaving. By now, several of her courtiers had spoke praises for the exquisite detail and finish of the garment, even if she herself apparently couldn't see it. Nonetheless, there was no mistaking the effect the material had on those around her, judging by the way everyone watched the process with rapt attention. Suddenly turning to her retainer, the queen questioned, "What do you think of it?"*
>
>*Stiffening, the zebra stammered, "Wellâ¦ uh, it is certainly a fascinating, intricate design. One that certainly leaves an impact on anyone who sees it." Nervously scratching behind his ear, the zebra added, "You will look marvelous in this garment, Your Majesty. A wonder of the ages."*
>
>*Satisfied for the moment, the lioness awaited the end of the process, standing in silence while the hyenas twirled the strings of the loom in a dizzying manner. Finally, the loom fell still, and the weavers came to stand in front of their ruler. They held up their creation for inspection, displaying the outfit between their empty paws.*
>
>*"Uh, yes, it's quite remarkable," Queen Zariqua muttered, reluctantly faking scrutiny of the garment, hoping they couldn't tell that she was unable to see it at all.*

Lioness queen is tricked into attending her coronation naked.

>*It was an order to her guards, and they promptly listened, stopping everything that they were doing, and backing off from my naked form. My heart was beating like the wings of a wasp as I watched the Queen move up closer to me. The smell wafting off of her bodyâthat stale and musky smellâwas strong enough to choke me. It was the same smell that had permeated my clothes, likely a pheromone of sorts, a chemical signal that the Queen was emitting to her loyal subjectsâand to me, too?*
>
>*She came to a stop; she was so close to me that I could feel the heat radiating off of her carapace. Her antennae were twitching like crazy, her abdomen was shaking, and a large line of spittle was dribbling down from her mouth, landing on the tip of my boot. Why hadn't she had killed me yet?*
>
>*That's when it dawned on me. This whole charade wasn't a threat, it was an invitation; an invite to mateâan invitation to impregnate. It was an invitation that I didn't want to accept.*

Getting a blowjob from a giant, monster bug?

I guess that's one way you're going to complete the desert hard diaries (runescape joke).

>
>*"Oh no," she said lightly. "she has been naught but kind in her treatment of me."*
>
>*The knight narrowed his eyes as he ran his gaze over the dragon. "She? Tis' a she?"*
>
>*The princess nodded cheerily. "Aye, a most sweet creature. And I believe she had something to tell you, didn't you darling?"*
>
>*The dragon shifted nervously, her large reptilian eyes fixed on Sir Reinhold. She loosed an adorable yelp that was completely unbecoming of such a fearsome beast and inched closer to the princess, who put a reassuring hand on her massive snout.*
>
>*"Come now, dearest, there's no need to be shy." said the princess gently. "Go on, tell him what you wanted to say."*

A dragon had kidnapped the princess! A tailor-made quest for the the kingdom's top knight, Sir Reinhold.

>*The prince felt Hyra spasm and shake under him, alarming the meek man until she finally burst out in a high-pitched, mocking bout of inhuman laughter, "You'd know if gnolls could knock-up a human, this whole place would be crawling with 'em!" Finally, Hyra stifled her mirth and responded evenly, "My dumbass kids keep getting killed. I gotta keep pumping out pups to fill the tribe with loyalists. That means I gotta get bred by the strongest gnoll. You got a problem with it, take it up with Rauncher, I don't care. Wait, actually, don't go near Rauncher--" But it was too late, and Hyra was surprised to find Otto angry beyond words as he fidgeted about in her lap like a riotous child during bath-time.*
>
>*The proud royal was absolutely incensed by this revelation. Otto had been walking on eggshells to countenance himself to Hyra's domineering nature. And all the while she had been off getting impregnated by gnolls? This was unacceptable, even if he hadn't always been entirely honest with his wife, occasionally undermining her more ferocious and ill-advised actions. Otto had managed to keep his clandestine project of nursing Hyra's shrimpy wedding-day victim back to health a secret, but that didn't justify this betrayal. After realizing he couldn't wrench free of the big hyenid woman's hold, Otto finally blurted out, "I demand satisfaction, I demand my honor be upheld! I demand a duel!" Hyra just rolled her eyes at this revelation, hoping her little human lover didn't get himself hurt.*

A second part to prompt 4199, "Gnarled Gnolls and Gory Gowns." This action-packed adventure sees the turbulent relationship between the human royal, Otto, and his new gnoll wife, Hyra, expand and develop as the challenges of inter-species marriage compound. Will their unlikely union end in tragedy, or triumph?

>
>*"I am well. I have not seen my sisters in ages." He said with a smile.*
>
>*Kurumi woke next. "What happened?" She asked.*
>
>*"You were both asleep for over two thousand years. You were the last ones to sleep. We were waiting for your return." He answered.*
>
>*She nodded. "Thank you for waking us up. But why did we need to be awakened?"*
>
>*"Because there is something that needs to be done." He told her.*

Two near immortal lovers reawakened after an indetermable amount of time. There's some epic destiny for them, but they just want to cuddle and love ach other.

>*She signed up for this job as a summer gig before the next semester of high school, figuring it'd be a perfect fit considering how she did roller derby. After getting onboarded, Alison was zipping around Jackson Diner like she was born for it: making small talk with the customers, rattling off orders to the kitchen, and even doing some minor tricks when the fancy hit her.*
>
>*Things changed, however, on a sunny day in July. Alison was weaving down the tables with a tray full of milkshakes. Then, she saw her.*
>
>*A girl, sitting alone at Booth 8, blonde hair framing her pale face as she stared down at a book. Her shoulders were slim but straight as she read with perfect posture. She wore the immaculate uniform of the local private school, Yarrow Prep: navy blazer, white blouse, and plaid skirt.*
>
>*She was the most beautiful girl Alison had ever seen.*

Alison was a girl who took on a summer job waitressing and rollerskating at the retro Jackson Diner. It was a good way to earn some bucks during the summer, though she didn't anticipate falling head over heels for the mysterious girl at Booth 8. Now all she's gotta do is to learn her name before the end of her shift...though that may be easier said than done.

>*"S-stinky?" she blurted incredulously, somehow that being the first thing she objected to.*
>
>*"I have a nose, girl," the cheetah said with a teasing lilt, "And you smell real pent up." Her weight pressed against Amy's chest as the cat leaned in close, still keeping their bodies locked together as she reached up to delicately sniff Amy's neck. She could feel the thin fur on the cheetah's snout slide along the sensitive skin under her chin as her curious tongue came out to explore the crevice between her neck and jaw.*
>
>*"S-sorry, I'mâ¦ It-it's the, ahâ"*
>
>*"Heat," the spotted cat giggled, "I know. Most girls get this way every now and then." The subtle shift of her hips had them pressed tightly against one another, causing the young deer to clench her thighs together instinctively. "Butâ¦ nobody should have to suffer through it alone."*

>*I began to mention the idea of a weekend trip we planned to do together, when she suddenly I heard a knock at the door. I wondered who it could be so early, but I went over, opened the door, and found myself face to face with a man in a business suit. He looked wholly out of place here, in this remote village where people maintained the old ways of the town.*
>
>*"Oh. Hello." I said calmly, a bit confused, though also curious at the same time.*
>
>*He tapped one finger to his earpiece, and whispered into it: "He's here."*
>
>*"I'm sorry, what is this about? Is there a problem?"*
>
>*He paused, adjusting his tie uncomfortably. He let out a long sigh, before answering, "Well... we need to talk."*
>
>*The look on his face made me nervous, and I tried to repeat: "What? Talk about what? About what?"*

Kitsunes, a perfect happy lovey dovey world, and literally my least favorite recurring antagonist: reality. If you wake up, it's all returning to nothing.

>*However, after the second display, we find ourselves drifting into an extended section of darkness. Before long, I can hardly see anything, barely able to make out Scott's form right next to me. And it is here where he makes a strange comment, saying "Hey, did you know that these dark rides aren't just for kids? In fact, there's a sort of tradition amongst teenagers and other couples to ride these dark rides and get up to some rather intimate stuff in the darkness. Where nobody can see you... why, I'm sure there's quite a lot of people that felt free to finally show their affection in a way they didn't dare to in public. Sounds nice, doesn't it?"*

For quite some time now, I've been harboring feelings for my best friend, feelings that are deeper than just friendship. And him inviting me to an amusement park definitely doesn't help in keeping those feelings at bay. But then, he takes me along on a dark ride, and there, as the tunnel swallows our little vehicle, he makes a sly comment. Does he know, and does he want me to make the move?

>*He doesn't seem to notice me, though the reading corner is a bit off to the side, so it makes sense. Quietly, I watch as he looks around nervously before heading over to one of the employees. He seems to be asking something, but I can't hear anything because he's being real hush-hush about it, which really makes me wonder just what he's looking for. And when he apparently gets his answer and takes off, I see why... he's heading right for the adult section. Now, really, I shouldn't stick my nose in things where it doesn't belong, but I just can't resist wanting to know more.*
>
>*When a few moments have passed, I get up from the bean bag chair and follow him into the adult section, where it doesn't take long for me to spot him again, but it's where I spot him that throws me off. There he stands, Elias, my sporty friend that I would figure could be swarming with girls if he wanted to... looking at gay romance novels.*

This town has a bookstore that's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Nobody's quite sure who exactly the target audience for this sort of all-night book store is, but I actually find myself dropping by in the dead of night frequently, just for the ambiance of it all. But tonight, I spot someone I know heading for the adult section, and I can't resist following...

>*Now I'm just completely dumbstruck. I can't even manage to stifle a laugh. "You... you can't be my girlfriend!" I reply, confused that I even have to say it.*
>
>*But he just looks at me like what I'm saying is incomprehensible. "Why not?" is all he asks in return.*
>
>*I can't believe this guy! He either just doesn't know how these things are supposed to work, or doesn't care. "Y-You're... a guy!" I say, still in awe in a weird way.*
>
>*"Yeah, and? Momma always said it's what's on the inside that counts, bro! So I'll be the best girlfriend on the inside I can be, and then ya won't have to cry anymore!" he explains, like it's the simplest thing in the world. "We'll do girlfriend things, like, uh, holdin' hands, sharin' chocolate on Valentine's Day, or gettin' under the covers together!"*

One would think that I'd eventually learn that I just can't get relationships to work, but no, now I find myself in another breakup. But while I sit in my dorm room, sulking and stewing in my misery, my roommate shows up and tries to cheer me up... in his own way.

>*The mood in the room takes a turn at this point, almost like the temperature is rising just from us both knowing what it is that's happening here. Ellis, being blind and all, has never actually seen my face before. In a way, he sees through touch. I'm sure this is something he's been thinking about for quite some time, and only now he's managed to summon up the bravery to actually ask the question. This is an intimacy level we've never gone to before.*

Living with a blind roommate has changed quite a few things about how I live my life, but at the same time, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm very glad to have him as a roommate and a friend. However, one day, he makes a slightly more... intimate request of me. Of course, I oblige, but this might change our relationship forever...

>*Lucius reaches out to caress his cheek, a sudden serious look on his face. "Lord Raymond... we care about you, but you still keep those walls up around you. Soon, we'll be moving out, to fight a war we don't know if we can win. So... I want to show you the warmth we have for you. The love that you've been rejecting. Please, Lord Raymond... if just for one night, indulge us," he says.*
>
>*All the while, Raven's expression just shifts multiple times, and it's so clear he's confused. He wants to protest, to throw us out... but he can't bring himself to do it.*

As a young tactician that now travels with a large group trying to save the world from a great evil, there are many people that I have to take care of and help out, though I will always make time for Lucius, the one that rescued me from a grave darkness clouding my mind. While we currently rest at one of the noblemen's castles, he asks me to help him with his friend, a sullen mercenary that needs some love.

>*The amateur hairdressing noble was surprised to find Hyra's coat of fur possessed a fluffy, curly springiness when unencumbered by saturating body oils. Her tan, mottled coat soon puffing out fantastically, almost comically compared to her earlier unkempt countenance. Tactfully finishing the primping session by massaging beard oil through her thick, scruffy mane, Otto noticed Hyra finally open her beady eyes, their rims slightly crusted with dried tear gunk and bath residue. The small, human prince immediately tensed with anxiety as Hyra's expression suddenly flared with indiscernible gnollish emotions, her trembling paw passing across her soft, bouncy mane. Otto was poised to make a break for it, until Hyra's throaty voice grumbled out, "I'm...pretty. You made me pretty..."*

Both obligations and privileges abound for the royal princes of the Barlow family, which rules the beset Bruin kingdom. Otto Barlow has been entrusted with the kingdom's northern principality, a land beset by barbarous and bestial races of a fetid nature, who worship perverse and violent gods. Managing to carve out a life of luxury for himself, the carefully-managed equilibrium of Otto's fraught realm is challenged by a massive political maneuver from the royal family. How will the pampered princeling cope after getting an intimate introduction to gnollish culture at the hands of Hyra the Head Hewer, a gnoll warrior queen of ferocious and unstable temperament?

>*"Nigel?" I'd head a familiar voice ask, followed by a "Are you still awake?" coming from behind the door to my study. I turned, then, baffled as I watched Lana creep into my bedroom, a candle in her hand.*
>
>*She looked desperate, then; all her usual confidence and certainty was replaced by an air of despair. Lana looked like she'd seen a ghost. Her gorgeous, lush, chestnut colored hair was tied in a lazy braid that hugged her shoulder. And I couldn't help but notice this being the first time I saw my childhood friend in a nightgown.*
>
>*Only another utterance of my name pulled me out of my reverie over the sight Lana inadvertently presented to me.*
>
>*"Wh-why yes, Lana, I'm wide awake," I whispered back to her, watching with glee as a warm smile spread across her desperate face. Not wanting to be too noisy I motioned for her to join me in sitting on my bed, which she quickly did and pulled me into a tight embrace; but not before safely placing the candle on by bedside table.*
>
>*"Oh, Nigel," Lana muttered into my chest as she held onto my arms, "I just couldn't find any calm on my own tonight."*

Wax poetically about a friend of old you share a wall and hidden door with. Comfort her through a night most dark and dreary.

>*"I'm going shopping! Be right back!"*
>
>*I barely had the time to process all that before she slammed the door behind her. I ran towards the window, where I saw her putting on her helmet and straddling her bike.*
>
>*"Hey! What are you getting?" I called.*
>
>*"Stuff!" Millie shouted. "Stay put!" And off she flew down the street.*
>
>*There was nothing for me to do but to wait for her. After what seemed like hours, my doorbell rang. I opened it and saw Millie grinning triumphantly. The basket of her bike was loaded (very precariously) with bags.*
>
>*"What's all this?" I asked.*
>
>*"A trip to paradise," she said, tromping off toward my backyard with me and her bike in tow.*

It was another boring day of a featureless summer vacation, way out in the middle of nowhere. If only I could go to a tropical island somewhere... that'd be the best. Unfortunately, I was stuck out here in the sticks. However, it seems that my childhood friend Millie is determined to make, at least in some small way, my dream a reality.

>*"Did you say something, darling?" Kasumi asked brightly as she walked back over and sat down on the bed again, her fluffy tails covering me a second time.*
>
>*"Just a little coughing fit," I lied.*
>
>*"Well, this should help with that!" Kasumi said as she stirred the soup, "Chicken noodle! That's what humans have when they're sick, right?"*
>
>*"Right," I said with a smile. Kasumi looked so enthusiastic about something as simple as just taking care of the person she loved, and I found myself falling for her all over again.*
>
>*"Great! Open wide then, darling!" Kasumi said as she lifted a spoonful of soup up out of the bowl.*
>
>*"Kass, I'm fully capable ofâ"*

After catching a nasty case of the flu, your Kitsune girlfriend (and hopefully, soon to be wife) Kasumi comes over to nurse you back to health! Can you stop her from finding out about the surprise of your planned proposal as she does all she can to make you feel better?

>
>*"I'm hoping to keep it that way," I said. "The relic we've been looking for is inside, and it's the Mirror of Deepest Desires. So to avoid any... embarrassing moments, don't... look into it."*
>
>*She seemed to take a moment to understand before a teasing simper broke out on her face. "Oh! You don't want your trusty elf compatriot peering into the dark crevices of the human psyche, eh? Your perverted mind's dreams getting leaked?"*
>
>*"Oh, shut up. Look, it's not that. I'm just warning you. That thing is dangerous. What if one of our deepest desires is something that changes our adventuring forever, you know?"*
>
>*While I braced for another simply flippant remark from my lackadaisical friend, a serious tone crept into her voice. "Right, yeah... wouldn't want to give that up."*

There's no start to a relationship like a relic accidentally revealing each other's deepest desires. But said desires, they are not degenerate. They are happy ever after marriage. With all that on the table, it's time to get serious with Sana, your dorky elf... friend? Lover? It's complicated. Thanks a lot, fuckin'... mirror...

### *Oil, Metal, and Romance*

>*A whoop of excitement broke me out of my contemplationâI spun to see a pair of legs clad in cargo pants hanging from the engine compartment. As the legs emerged, a white, grease stained tank top was revealed until finally her head was clear. The face that gazed at me had slightly thick eyebrows, tousled blonde hair, a small nose and freckles, as well as a smear of machine grease on her forehead. My childhood friend was examining the plane I'd landed; She'd been the one to repair it. Jeanne was a certified greasemonkey, while I was a pilot and She had roped me into a test flight of her latest project. Her thorough examination of the craft didn't take longâsoon the tomboyish mechanic turned to regard me with bright eyes, completely unfazed by the grease and oil stains on her top half.*
>
>*"Well?" she asked expectantly, her tone slightly anxious.*
>
>*I took off my cap and ran my fingers through my short brown hair. "It's fine," I nodded, "the thing flies like a dream."*
>
>*"I'll be damned!" Jeanne grinned like an excited child, flinging her arms wide. "Hug!"*

You've just completed a test flight for your childhood friend and skilled mechanic, Jeanne. After checking the plane over, she wants nothing more than a big hug...right?

>*Lain, and by extension, her NAVI, was considered by many to be the queen of the Wired World: a digital realm that connected humanity. The Wired had overtaken Lain's life in every way, as if she had no choice but to be its goddess. And it was all through this hulking machine that had crowded her bedroom.*
>
>*Lain suddenly had a strange idea. She crawled close to the blackened main screen of her NAVI, seeing her own reflection in the screen. Lain bent in close and whispered to the machine:*
>
>*"I love you."*

Lain loves her NAVI very much.

### *The Contract*

>*"It's been a decade, Human, more than enough time to settle down. I see no wife! I see no children!" She snarled, "How am I supposed to get the firstborn I was promised?"*
>
>*"IâI don't know," I stammered...it wasn't like I hadn't wanted a wife and kids to share my home with.*
>
>*She rose from her seat; fire burning in her eyes as she started to pace. Long, tanned legs flashed beneath her dress and her crimson hair whipped around her head, framing her pointed ears and snapping black eyes. "You have a duty to fulfill your end of the bargain, Human. What is it you plan to do about it?"*
>
>*"I'm sorry," my words fell flat against her anger. "I can't give you what you want."*
>
>*I could almost see her mind working, her brow furrowing as she ran through her options in her head. She quickly discarded the thought of forcing me to find a woman. Instead, she began pacing again; her hands balled into fists at her sides. "What if there were another way?"*
>
>*"Another way? What are you talking about?" My curiosity piqued.*

At death's doorstep, you promised your firstborn child in exchange for salvation. A decade later, single and childless, your worst fear comes true when the demoness returns to claim your firstborn. Out of desperation, a bargain is struck.

>*After dinner, Shanella insisted that she take care of booking a room. So, while I waited, she talked quietly to Gaius near the bar. It didn't take long for her to conclude the business before returning to collect me. She led me up the stairs and to our roomânaturally, I entered first to check for any danger to the diplomat.*
>
>*What I saw gave me pause. Instead of there being two beds, one for the diplomat and one for Iâher knightly escortâthere was only a single, large bed. A couple's bed.*
>
>*Spinning on my feet, I glanced in askance at Shanella only to see her locking the door behind us. "Shanella?"*
>
>*"It's exactly what you suspect," she said simply.*

You've been assigned to show the Elven diplomat around the city and, after a day of taking in the sights, Shanella has arranged for some alone time with you without your knowledge. Dive right in to the action, so to speak.

>*"Hi."*
>
>*"What brings you here today?"*
>
>*"Just looking at your workâit's really good."*
>
>*She beams at me. "Thanks! You should see some of the stuff that comes out of here; it's hard work. But when it's done right, like thisâ" she holds up the piece of armor, "âit's amazing."*
>
>*"I can imagine. Set that aside, I've brought you a treat." I cajole her over to the counter where a dish of ice keeps sliced watermelon cool.*
>
>*I can see the delight in Millie's eyes as she spies the fruit, but her gaze quickly drops to her hands with an abashed frown. "My hands are dirty from soot and sweat..." She laments, looking for a clean cloth.*

After watching your blacksmith friend at work, you feed her some refreshing watermelon so that she doesn't have to touch it with her hands and things take a turn for the sensual.

>*Queen Beryl awaited atop her flowery throne for the foolish Sailor Scouts to arrive, eager to achieve the Dark Kingdom's final victory by wiping away the last traces of the Moon Kingdom's existence. This carefully prepared battlefield would bear witness to her glorious victory, and herald her status as the greatest of sorceresses to have ever existed. If she could exterminate those pitiable girls, Queen Metalia would surely grant Beryl greater access to the overwhelming powers of the Negaverse. The only trouble that anxiously gnawed at the slender woman's proud mind, was the unlikely resilience the Sailor Scouts suddenly enjoyed against her powerful augury magic.*
>
>*The sorceress had been unable to keep tabs on the five feminine thorns in her side, and so prepared enchanted countermeasures to ensnare each Sailor, preying upon their respective weaknesses. Queen Beryl would personally confront Sailor Moon herself, while the mighty lunar champion's guardians were disunited and disposed of by her minions and traps. But, when an ominous sliding noise rapidly approached Queen Beryl's personal dais, the powerful enchantress was caught off-guard by the failure of her scrying charms. A hissing voice rose out from behind, "Hey, Queen Beryl, check it out."*

Queen Beryl's got cute feet, what more do you need to hear?

>
>*The melancholic monotony of the summer evening is broken by the lovely voice of your cousin.*

>*"Sex." the girl laying on the bed says, continuing to stare at the ceiling.*

>*"Do to me." she responds.*
>
>*"You can't just ask for sex like that!" you grunt.*
>
>*"Why?" she turns to you and looks into your eyes, her face devoid of any emotions. "We did before."*

>*She was always like this.*

During my testing she managed to keep her dejected demeanor, but your mileage may vary.

The policeman had explained that the young lizard woman was likely targeted because of her looks, petite stature, and taste for expensive jewelry. Even as time went on, she couldn't shake the horrid memories of being wantonly groped as her beloved bijoux were systematically seized. The stinking criminal had slunk off from an alarming noise before events could proceed too drastically, but Alina couldn't forget how close she was to suffering an even more invasive exploitation. Determined to regain her power and abandon her agoraphobic seclusion, the meek reptile woman began taking precautions to walk the streets without fear.*

Some dogs require frequent walking to relieve their natural tension and energy and keep their physique healthy. Responsible pets owners should make sure they can keep up with their pet's demanding natures when selecting an appropriate dog breed.

>*Golden shod hooves clapped against the rocky path, its rough travel betraying its lack of visitors. The pair atop the horse were equally finely-adorned, their dark robes sewn with beads and gemstones that glistened in the sun's rays. Despite their finery and garb, neither one looked happy as they rode on, with the man at the reins sweaty and strained and the youth seated behind him staring impassively at the scenery passing by.*
>
>*At last the path leveled out, revealing the mouth of a cave, thick with shadows the rays of the setting sun failed to pierce. The pair dismounted and made their way towards its entrance, the young prince trailing after his sire without a word. They paused outside the opening, the boy brushing up against the back of his father's robes as he stared into the darkness within. The elder man fidgeted nervously before turning towards his son.*
Shitty king foists his brat on his ancient, scaly relative.

>*"Good morning, X789."*
>
>*The Babysitter's corrugated voice scraped my eardrums, dragging me out of my drugged sleep. I blinked against the harsh fluorescent lights, tensing as the Babysitter removed my IV. Her mandibles closed around the tube in a hungry suckling motion. Every part of my body screamed at me to runâbut there was nowhere to go. Beyond the door of my cell were countless others identical to it. In this concrete hell, there were no windows to look out of, no stars to gaze upon...only the sad sight of imprisoned Children guarded by a grotesque menagerie of Babysitters.*
>
>*Ruling over it all was Mother, who we never saw. All we knew was that sometimes, the Babysitters came for certain Children and took them away forevermore.*
>
>*"You need more nutrition," the Babysitter said after she finished. "Don't you want to be strong for Mother?" She stroked my cheek in a hideous facsimile of a caress, then grasped my hand with her claw. The door of my cell opened, and we joined the stream of Children heading towards the dining hall.*

Step into the dark world of the Cells, where you are Subject X789. In this concrete purgatory, you are one of Mother's Children, watched over by a menagerie of grotesque Babysitters. As your fellow Children succumb to the corrosive effects of this dystopian dungeon, can you survive with your soul intact?

>*With a sad expression on your face, you watch as the room of holidays argue before you. Santa, to most a jolly fellow, shakes his fist in frustration at Thanksgiving, represented by an unhappy turkey. A scowl spreads across his face and he glares down at the bird with malice in his eyes.*
>
>*"Lord of Holidays, you must resolve this injustice!" Santa calls to you, sitting on your decorated throne, which rests in a place in-between reality, a neutral ground for all holiday disputes taking the form of a court room, which floats gently on a sea of pitch-black dreams.*
>
>*You look over at the fat man, still holding your tired frown, but knowing that it's time to get serious. "Okay, from the top again, please. What seems to be the problem?" You ask.*
>
>*"The holidays are out of whack! Thanksgiving is too close to Christmas, Christmas comes too late, New Years isn't even a real holiday," Santa replies. You hear an insulted "Hey!" from a cartoony star in the back of the throne room like the ones you'd see on a Happy New Years card, except frowning and clearly upset.*

You must babysit all the holidays, solve their squabbles, and let happiness return to mankind. If that means eradicating some holidays, so be it! New ones will replace the old.

>*A soft dusting of snow whitens the asphalt of the parking lot as I finally get to close up the shop after another long shift. Just like every other day, business has been slow on these cold, dark winter evenings, but it's not like I really care that much, I get paid all the same. Well, at least that's usually how things go, but today I've actally been rather antsy to get off work. Just a few hours into my shift, I got a message from old man Jenson that the blinds on Liam's place have been closed all the time and he hasn't been answering the door bell, which is worrying. As this is the kind of suburb where everybody knows everybody, people generally know that Liam and I are childhood friends. Not to mention, I've somehow managed to get myself in the position of a sort of local emotional support just by being willing to help whoever comes to me with troubles.*

>*Well, it's Friday night, andâlike millions of other losersâI'm doing nothing but sitting in front of a television. My evening differs from theirs in one way, however: tonight I'm babysitting an eleven-year-old girl named Zoe. Zoe's mother is good friends with my sister, and their relationship has somehow led to me babysitting her little urchin after my sister's realization that my new apartment is a mere four blocks from her friend's. Despite both my earnest protests, and my argument that an eleven-year-old doesn't need a babysitter for a single weekend, the pair of women were able to extract my guarantee that I would watch Zoe for the full weekend while they go off to God-knows-where on some sort of "Girl's Excursion".*

>*"Time to brush your tail!" you say as you pull out a brush.*
>
>*"No, I don't want to!" She thrashes and squirms in your arms, trying to escape.*
>
>*"Stop struggling, you little vixen." You hold her under one arm as she flails her arms and legs around.*
>
>*"Mom, help! He's brushing me again!" She reaches toward your wife, Ayumu, who just entered the room.*
>
>*"Fu-fu-fu, my dear husband and my lovely daughter are bonding, how adorable!" Your wife laughs softly in response.*
>
>*At that moment, you notice something - your daughter has not just one tail, but two!*
>
>*"You grew a second tail? When did this happen?" you ask Yumi, delighted to see such a thing.*

>*"Mom, what is THAT?" I asked, pointing to the android sitting idly in the doorway next to my mother.*
>
>*"Oh, that's your new babysitter," she said casually. "It's a robo-maid, for when I'm working during the day."*
>
>*"A robot maid? You're going to let some machine take care of me?!" I cried out in horror.*
>
>*My mother let out an annoyed sigh, putting her hands on her hips. "Yes, because I've spoiled you. Don't you remember what you did to your last few babysitters?"*
>
>*I thought about that for a moment. The last babysitter, I think her name was Cindy, I was admittedly acting like a bratty little kid... but this one isn't even human! I mean, it looks somewhat human... in shape, it is definitely a female android... and there was something nice about the traditional Japanese maid outfit it wore: a black dress with a white apron overtop, complete with frilly lace at the collar and cuffs. It also had a cute hairstyle adorned with ribbons and bows. But how could I possibly trust something so foreign with my life?!*

Lesson here is, be a brat, get a robot maid to coddle and reward you. 2022 parenting, amirite?

>*A long winding road snakes between the trees, finally reaching a small clearing. Your feet feel sore from the long journey, so you decide to make a camp for the night. But amidst the twilight that enshrouds the woods, some unusual lights glitter. You walk a bit farther to investigate them, wary of the dangers they might house, but as you approach are greeted with a facade of the tavern. It is adorned with strange round white lanterns that seem to be magical in nature. The sign above the door reads "Tavern in the Woods".*
>
>*Ignoring the unoriginal name, the tavern is a welcome sight for you. Perhaps suspiciously convenient, even. Nevertheless, you decide to open the door and enter.*
>
>*The interior is quite well lit and has several tables and chairs, but the only living person is a woman behind the counter. She has long blonde hair, perfect fair skin and most noticeable - long elven ears. The young lady hums a song as she churns something in the bowl.*
>
>*As you open the door farther, it hits the bell, and it's clear ringing sound catches her attention.*

If getting tricked into having passionate sex with an elf is your biggest problem, I want your kind of problems.

>*Little Eve hissed happily as she was hoisted and flung about in the calloused hands of her beloved, the pious man utterly lost in strychnine-induced revelry. The Pentecostal congregants chanted with devotional fervor, an electric feeling of great spirit filling the room. Devotional, exalting men whirled about, praising the Lord in strange languages, their fists wreathed with serpents. The most Godly of them passed about a mason jar, each man merrily sipping strychnine-laden water in praise of God's glory and sacred covenant with Mankind. The fattened diamondback rattler was happy just to be close to Enoch, her passion's sole focus.*
>
>*The sonorous timber of Enoch's deep voice as he chanted healing prayers and spoke in syllabic tongues sent her serpentine heart aflutter. Eve didn't mind at all when he gripped her a tad too tight in his exuberance, the comforting warmth of his firm hands was always welcomed. She'd only bitten him a few times, drawn into the group's ecstatic mood and acting on her ingrained viper instincts in the moment. Every year spent together with Enoch further cemented Eve's utter devotion to the big preacher man, and his heartfelt mission to espouse the wonder of God and his son, Jesus Christ. Her triangular head swayed and her hollow tail-tip subtly rattled to the hymn's rhythm, the joyous snake caught up in the religious revival like usual.*

>*You close the door and turn the key, locking it. Finally, home. Hanging your wet umbrella and shoes to dry and setting a bag of groceries onto the cabinet, you enter the living room - after a full day of work, you just want to crash onto the sofa and give your legs a few minutes of rest. But as you approach the sofa, you see that it is already occupied - a little girl is sleeping soundly on it.*
>
>*"What the!?" you exclaim as you step back.*
>
>*The girl opens her eyes and looks sleepily at you. She rubs them with her forearm as she sits up.*
>
>*"Who are you? What the hell are you doing here?" you lean in as you interrogate the little intruder.*
>
>*"I'm sorry! I am just..." the girl cowers and puts her arms in front of herself for protection, as if afraid you'll hit her.*
>
>*"Hey, I am not going to hurt you." you feel a bit bad for scaring her, "I just want to know how you got in here."*
>
>*The girl doesn't say anything, but glances at the window. The morning was hot, so you'd opened it slightly for some fresh air and forgot to close it. With her delicate frame, it would be possible to squeeze in through the gap even with the latch on.*
>
>*"Good grief." you sigh, "Well, whatever. Just get out of here. I don't want any trouble." you tell her.*
>
>*You escort the little girl to the door, and she leaves your house in a hurry. Standing in the doorway, you watch her lithe silhouette depart as she walks across the street, feeling bad about yourself for getting angry and treating her like this.*
>
>*The rain seems to have died down, for now, just the water running off the roof makes a sloshing sound. The girl approaches one of the houses on the other side and stands in front of the door, as if unwilling to enter. Despite the distance, you can hear the voices yelling from the inside and the sound of something breaking. The girl turns her body at a ninety-degree angle and starts slowly walking along the street. With every step she takes, you see more and more droplets making circles on the surface of puddles as the rain starts to pick up.*
>
>*"Hey, you're going to catch a cold." gnawed by guilt, you decide to call out to her, "Come here."*

This girl radiates the need to protect. Good job on the writer's part!

>*Loria Van Bernhardt stoically suppressed the urge to shiver as she clambered with her guide through the treacherous mountain crags, a bitter wind howling about them. The hardened Violet Knight continually aimed the wide shield slung to her side in the blowing wind's direction, stamping her hobnailed boots to fight back the encroaching frostbite. The robust warrior found herself struggling to keep up with the wiry elder's progress as they marched ahead. Yelling out over the roaring gales, Loria asked, "Grier, how do you scale these damned cliffs like a mountain goat?"*
>
>*The robed man ahead shrugged, responding, "Many valuable reagents could be found in these old caverns before the dragon came. Come here, we are nearly at the hidden entrance." The old man stooped low, bundled up tight in his layered robes, gesturing towards an almost imperceptible fissure under a great, cracked boulder. As the female knight trundled up to his side, Grier opened a bundle of cloth, revealing a gleaming sword and stoppered vial. The wiry druid explained, "This sword has been enchanted to scythe through the drake's hardened scales effortlessly, and that berserker's brew will allow you to match his reflexes. Good luck."*
>
>*Loria quickly tested the odd sword, finding the balance off and blade wanting, eliciting her to ask, "Are you certain of this sorcery? Can I truly trust my life to this weapon?"*

Loria Van Bernhardt is a fantastic name, but sadly you see those tags on the prompt? Loria is not in for a good time, folks, but perhaps you will be.

>*With that, the curtain is ripped from my cage, and I can finally get a good look out into the studio. The lights are dimmed down-low, but even through the darkness, I can see the faces of the crowd and contestants. My heart skips a beat when I catch sight of the woman standing behind the booth; she's paleâalmost unnaturally soâand dressed in a deep, black gown. In fact, everyone in the audience looks like a corpse as well. It's like a sea of funeral attendees are watching from the stands.*
>
>*The host steps out from his podium, and moves to stand in front of the cage where I'm being kept like a prize pig at a fair. "The prize that our contestants will be playing for tonight is a twenty-four year old college student that's majoring in biochemistry. As you can see, he's a healthy young manânot too tall, not too shortâbut most importantly, he's got plenty of O-Negative blood in his body. He isn't known to donate regularlyâif at allâwhich means that he should have plenty of the stuff to spare." Looking back towards the contestants, the host continues, "Now, the question is: How much, exactly?"*
>
>*I try and rattle the bars open, but it's useless, the metal only digs into my arms and legs as I thrash around like a fish out of water. The cloth binding that's wrapped around my mouth is so tight that I can barely breatheâI can't even scream for help. It's not like anyone would help me, if I could, though.*
>
>*"Well, well, it looks like he's eager to play!"*

>*"And now," said the announcer, "it's time for the main event!" As he spoke, the lights dimmed, and a spotlight focused on center stage where two giant screens flickered to life showing the four contestants standing side by side, each wearing her crop top and tight-fitting jeans. The girls' faces were flushed with both embarrassment and excitement as they stood before their adoring fans. "Our four contestants today, are named..." he paused to read off their names from a piece of paper that had been handed to him moments earlier by his assistant, "...Abigail, Brooke, Emily, and Jenny." The crowd erupted into applause at the introduction of each girl, quieting down only after the announcer gestured with his hands.*
>
>*"Alright, ladies, you know the drill; our lovely staff will bring you each a glass of water every five minutes. If you fail to drink the water before the next cup arrives, or you wet yourself, you are DISQUALIFIED! And let me remind our viewers who weren't able to tune into the pre-show, that EACH of these beautiful darlings has already drank quite a bit of water, and is no doubt starting to feel the pressure!" As if to illustrate the announcer's point, Abigail shifted uncomfortably on her heels, crossing and uncrossing her legs before turning back to the camera. "So, without further ado, let us begin the thirteenth annual LG Bladder Holding Contest!" The crowd once again burst into raucous applause which died down naturally as the contestants made their way into position on stage.*

Every year, four young girls are chosen from around the country to participate in a widely televised bladder holding competition. The girl who can outlast the others gets twenty thousand dollars in prize money, as well as the privilege of relieving herself in the contest's trophy.

>*"That's it ye wee scallywag, no regrets now, yer my squeezebox and I like me toys," Card Shark whispered down in a husky tone, as she provocatively slipped several digits into Ploy's scaly snatch. The gecko woman's twin tails curled anxious around her forceful lover's thick thighs, as Card Shark leaned down and began wantonly licking into the defeated gambler's reptilian ear hole. Ploy groaned out heatedly around the bigger woman's nipple, trying to wriggle away from Card Shark's probing fingers and invasive tongue.*
>
>*Before Ploy knew it, gravity shifted as she realized the big shark woman was carrying her off down the arena stage. The shocked lizard girl looked up at the domineering lesbian plaintively, not daring to stop suckling at her breast. Card Shark looked down, and intuitively answered, "Well now, considern' yer loss, I've no right ta deny the crowd yer march of shame, do I, lassie? I'm eagerer than horsespit to see what color the crowd be decidin' to paint yer shiny scales, me quiverin' dolly. And then, I'll get to introduce ye to all the rich gentlemen that paid so nice n' dearly to get a little peak and peck of ye, that'll be a sight t'see, I reckon." Ploy desperately clutched at Card Shark's chest, quaking from the lesbian's cruel taunting. Even as the shark woman carried her, she kept wantonly fingering the gecko's roused vent. Suddenly, the big shark woman heaved Ploy unceremoniously onto the dusty ground, her digits withdrawing from the gecko's sex with a little squelch. "Right then, get ta walkin', lucky girl. I'll be right behind ye."*

When a gecko girl's dual tails enchants her life with supernatural luck, the feisty female sets out to win a high-stakes, strip poker tournament. But, will the seedy gambling hall's owner, the infamous Card Shark, allow the favored a fortune?

>*Ever since we were kids, she had a penchant for incredible recklessness. She was always careening headlong towards death, never looking back, never thinking twice about what might happen next. Her blue eyes were always turned towards some distant future, and the hunger in them made me nervous.*
>
>*And this was her chance, just as it was mine. One of us would take the win, and one of us would go home empty-handed.*
>
>*We waited there, an instant of eternity, till we heard the blow of the whistle that signaled the beginning.*
>
>*My heart kicked into high gear, adrenaline pumping through my veins. A split-second calculation flashed through me: I could try to beat Riley on pure speed, or impress the judges with acrobatics and trickery. I built my jetboard with scraps as an all-rounder, so theoretically either approach would work. But I knew that Riley had practiced more than anyone else in The Bricks, and her insane recklessness made her unpredictable. There was another option too: jetboarding had very few rules. Though direct harm to one's opponent is prohibited, a whole range of things are allowed, ranging from dirty tactics to sabotaging the track.*
>
>*All these flew through my body more as impulse than thought, and my body made its decision.*

After the Fall, a dangerous new sport became popular amongst the youth of the apocalypse: jetboarding. Risking life and limb on the hulking giants of rotting rollercoasters, this sport was the only way shantytown kids could attain fame and fortune...though corpses litter the road to glory. Ride the rails as an aspiring jetboarder!

>*Tammy looked up from her meal, smiling placidly at Nathan as she tried to reply, but couldn't manage to speak from around Brenda's thick, wriggling thighs. The snake-fox then turned her attention back to Brenda's squirming form, licking up every inch of flesh exposed to help lubricate the hefty woman's descent down the voracious snake-fox's serpentine throat. Nathan thought about physically intervening, but realized the huge serpentine vixen probably weighed five times what he did, and was blocking the doorway with her coils and Brenda. Looking back from the exit to the grisly scene, Nathan blanched to realize Brenda was now up to her hips in Tammy's mouth, and the snake-fox was still slurping up more of her victim's feminine curves.*

Nathan is a despondent writer that hates his job and his unromantic love-life. But, unbeknownst to the depressed man, every day God holds a contest to grant one earnest prayer from humanity. How will Nathan respond, to find his beloved waifu has become real by God's Grace?

The young cat woman would soon be doomed to endure hours of agonizing, torturous digestion inside the hungry canine's stomach. Randy's own beautiful cat woman was also watching the disgusting process unfold. The predated feline's eyes were filled with tears, as she looked back at her own owner, pleading silently for him to help her. Her owner just shook his head sadly, as he watched the cat-girl being eaten alive by the hungry canine.*

A bizarre version of a cat judging pageant, inspired by an old episode of Ren and Stimpy.

One after another, the tentacles find their way onto the edge of my boat; their suction cups latch on tightâso tight that the wood starts to crack and splinter under the pressure.*
>
>*Through the murky water I can see the beast, a large squid-like monster; its deep, orange skin looks like rubber, and there doesn't seem to be a soul behind its eyes, just a being that's working on primal urges.*
>
>*Then, with one final tug, the hull of my boat is torn asunderâand with it goes any chance making it out of here in one piece. As I try to keep from going down with my quickly sinking vessel, the squid's appendages inch closer to me. The creature doesn't want my boatâit wants me!*

Debeaked or not, giant monster squids need a little playtime tooâeven if it means taking it by force from innocent fishermen.

>*"Why does Spain only send animal girls to man their ships?" I asked.*
>
>*"Mmmmâ¦ Well, ye see, lad," Captain Baker began, leaning toward me conspiratorially. "Spain's overflowing with animal girls. They breed too much, the country can't afford to feed them all. So they've started filling all the cruddy jobs, sailor positions, and such." He gave me a wink. "But to horny pirates such as our little band here, they just look like tasty treats!"*
>
>*He chuckled at his own joke.*
>
>*"Are we going to not only take their treasure, but also the women?" I asked.*
>
>*"Aye! That's the plan," he answered with a grin. "A double victory. But most of all, it makes for good writin' material. We're all gonna be postin' stories about this voyage when we get back home."*
>
>*"So this entire boat is full of writers? It's not just me?" I asked.*

I've been feeling very wholesome as of recent so sorry respect kings, here's a story about learning how to plunder booty and find true love at the same time, with the support of a very friendly (and hmm, recognizable? Do I know this fellow??) captain.

>*The heated pirate queen watched every moment unfold before her with rapt attention, her eyes glued to the feminine silhouettes slowly rippling down the scaly length of Sausage's long body. She could see the way the snake's coiling muscles bulged and flexed around the struggling elf maidens, which were now completely enveloped by his slick, slimy flesh. As the serpent continued swallowing the last of his prey, Gloria noticed a pair of bronze-colored, slender hands despairingly gripping the edges of the serpent's slobbery cheeks. They belonged to the smallest of the three victims, who still wasn't entirely down Sausage's gullet.*
>
>*Gloria leaned in close to Renard's ear again, whispering sultrily, "Look at that, lad. See how those uncalloused hands are still tryin' ta cling on? That be the most erotic sight I've seen in a dog's age!"*

A concise story about a fantastical pirate voyage, filled with tense combat and exciting new experiences with a fluffy fox woman.

>*"Oh, how darling you are!" said the creature. "So very handsome! Such lovely features!" Her lithe hands felt my face in fascination, mapping the curve of my cheeks, the soft swell of my lips. Enamored coos spilled forth from her mouth and she pressed herself against my chest as if she sought to mold herself to my body. "And so warm, so alive!"*

>*Struggling fiercely against her grip, I surfaced enough to draw a great, heaving breath of air. The lake shore seemed so distant, my muscles burning as I fought to swim free. "Wh-what's happening? What the hell are you?" I spluttered, struggling to keep my head above water.*
>
>*"Lonely," the creature crooned, rubbing her cheek against mine. It was cold and clammy, seeming to sap the warmth from my skin with its touch. "I've been so lonely, ever since I died and was left to haunt this lake in solitude. All my love and care was nothing compared to his new lover's wealth â I was only a poor farmer's daughter, and could not give him the riches she could offer. And so, my beloved husband drowned me and married his lover." Dark, wide eyes gazed up through a mess of waterlogged hair, a mournful cry escaping her throat.*

While on a walk through the woods, you encounter a lake â and the strange being that inhabits it. Though the rusalka's body is long since cold, her ghostly heart still yearns for love.

>*A woman! But this was no ordinary woman â green scales caught the light, their metallic luster glittering like emeralds in the midday sun; her long hair billowed around her in the water in great luxuriant waves. Her features were proud and regal, heavy lashes framing a pair of bright amber eyes with thin pupils. She wore a cuirass, an odd sight on such a slim frame, but seemed to carry its weight effortlessly. I couldn't help but look further down, and what I saw only amazed me further. Beneath the strange woman's waist lay a long, green-scaled mermaid tail, fins trailing behind as she swam through the waters.*
>
>*The mermaid drew herself up to her full height in the water. "I am Lady Sereia, noble zitiron of the merfolk who dwell in these seas," she spoke, voice stately. "Fear not, land-walker, for I shall aid you."*

After a shipwreck strands you in the open sea, a mermaid knight takes it upon herself to help you.

>*For once, there's a bit of confusion on Andrew's face. "Bro, I swear, those guys on the Internet said this shit was guaranteed. I don't get it..." he trails off as he begins to look around.*
>
>*However, as he looks around, I find my eyes drawn to his naked body... and god damn, he looks good like that, all dripping wet and slick with water. He keeps in shape for sure, and his body shows the results. Trim and athletic... wait, what am I thinking? I'm not into dudes, right? But then, why am I hard right now? The cold water of the ocean should've dealt with that, right? And just as I find myself lost in thought, he turns to face me again, and of course he spots my erection right away, leading to him chuckling. "Heh, you like, bro? What, you gay or somethin'? I mean, I know I got a hot bod, but c'mon," he says, a smug grin plastered all across his face.*
>
>*While I find myself blushing from the sheer embarrassment, I can't help but notice... he's hard too! There's no way he can deny that, he's just as rock hard as I am! And so I can't help but confront him with it. "Hey, what about you, huh? If I'm so gay, what does that make you?" I throw back, and the moment Andrew looks down at himself, the smug grin disappears and he goes bright red.*

For some reason, my friend decided that the new hotness for spring break is to not go anywhere at all, that that was what all the cool, hot chicks were doing. This leaves the two of us at a deserted nude beach, with him insisting that this was going to work. But as the two of us head out of the water, all wet and glistening, we have ourselves a moment of our own...

>*As far as I'm concerned, I'm a bit in the middle right now. Not particularly hunting or anything like that, but wouldn't say no if somebody attractive were to show up and ask. Or at least that's what I thought when I first entered the place, because when I take a look around, I notice something unusual... or rather someone unusual. Sure, at first, one might miss the somewhat unassuming-looking fox sitting all by himself at a table in the corner, but upon closer inspection, one will notice a few peculiar things about him. For one, he's not the type to be here. Too slim, too small. This is very much a worker type of tavern, not the kind that attracts people with the build of a lordling. Similarly, you can tell he's got a certain luster in his fur. Everybody else's fur is matte and unkempt from all the work because we don't have the time nor materials to really take care of it.*
>
>*Mind, he's doing a great job just blending in the background with his dark attire. This is a guy that's on the lookout for something, and he doesn't want to draw attention to himself while he's doing that. And if he's here of all places, he's looking for someone for some... nocturnal escapades. There's no other reason to be here, really. But then, our eyes meet from across the room. No words are said here. Silently, his eyes narrow a bit, acknowledging me. His tail begins to swish just that little bit faster, that little bit more excited. A very slight smile creeping into his expression. God, why does he intrigue me so much?*

After a hard day's work, there's nothing like a drink at the Leaky Tankard, and if you're lucky, a night together with one of the other patrons as well. But when a new guy that doesn't fit the dingy atmosphere shows up, I find myself quickly captivated. And when he brings me to an absolutely majestic ship, I can only wonder... who the hell is this guy?

>
>*"What do you think you're doing eating my doughnut?" you look at her, faking anger.*
>
>*"I... I didn't know it was yours." she tries to defend herself.*
>
>*"Well, it was, and now you ate it. You are in a lot of trouble, young lady!" you reprimand her.*
>
>*"I am sorry! I didn't mean to..." the girl tries to scoot backwards.*

>*"I weren't kiddin' about sharin' me loot, ye know," the pantheress grumbled, glaring at the dolphin who'd bound her. "What kind o' bounty hunters won't even take a bribe?"*
>
>*"I think we have plenty of plunder right here," a female dolphin said from behind the feline, taking hold of her coat and rolling it down her shoulders. "Why don't you show us all what you've got underneath those clothes?"*
>
>*The black panther's ears flattened as the dolphin began to tug away at her jacket until it was off her body and trapped at her wrists by the rope. "Oi, getcher paws off me ye scrawny virgin!" Blackpaw snapped, squirming about in protest. "I could puke into yer mother's distended cunt an' sire a better lay than ye!"*
>
>*Pausing in disgust, the dolphin arched her brow at the pirate. "Ew. Can we gag her or something?"*

Dolphin bounty hunters get the better of Captain Blackpaw and her crew finds themselves enjoying the spectacle.

>
>*She came ashore and dragged herself onto the beach, slithering toward him. Her scales were the green of new spring foliage, and her body was long and supple, moving sinuously over the sand. She wrapped itself around him, piling plump, chubby coils upon his trembling form until he was completely covered by her bulk. His face pressed against her smooth underbelly as she held him tightly. He could hear her heart beating steadily behind the wall of muscle and fat that surrounded him.*
>
>*"Do not be afraid, sssweetling," she whispered into his ear. "I am a benevolant goddesss. I will take good care of you."*

A young man was chosen as a sacrifice for a serpentine sea goddess.
His fate is less dire than expected.

>*We collectively raced toward the ship with motors screaming and an occasional burst of lead towards the sky; the huge ship was almost upon us. Our boats rode over surges with an grace unbefitting their age and disrepair, as if the old rust buckets shared our passion and fury. Mudskipper and I's turbo-boat was among the first to reach the ship, so we left the others to catch up; I worked at our scrapper's grapple caster, finalizing a few key adjustments to the device's automated boarding system. By an act of some forsaken God, the boarding device blinked online.*
>
>*The crew inside must have seen us approaching; lights blinked along the superstructure and something large and bulky loomed out from the darkness above our deck. We heard gunfire over our roar as the big guns opened fire on our boat.*
>
>*My boat-brother hunkered down behind the scrap-armor paneling of our boat, occasionally retaliating with a few potshots. "Hurry, ya scutter!" Mudskip growled, his words slurring into a confused mumble as he cowered, "I'm stayin' here."*
>
>*I fired off one last round before giving a nod and grappling my way up the side of the mega-ship's hull, soon accompanied by my lagging crewmates; it was an absolute melee. We knew These mega-ships were their own self contained cities. They needed to be. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people lived upon these enormous vessels, which despite their technologically advanced systems were just as in need of repair as anything else. Lord only knew how many of these cradles of humanity remained, and we'd pilfer em' all, given the chance.*

>*"What are you looking at?" she asks gruffly; her voice is low but has an edge to it like a blade. She doesn't sound angry or aggressive so much as simply annoyed with me for being there. This girl clearly isn't used to people paying attention to her.*
>
>*"I was wondering who you were," is my response. "I don't think we've met."*
>
>*"Ohana Itachizame," she replies curtly. "And if you're going to stare at me then you better have a good reasonâI don't take kindly to stalkers."*
>
>*"I'm not stalking you; just admiring your beauty from afar," is my reply. Ohana's face turns surprised for a brief moment before turning into a scowl once again.*
>
>*"What's so special about me?" she asks with obvious annoyance.*
>
>*"You're pretty and you seem interesting, plus, you aren't afraid to speak your mind," I answer honestly. Ohana's eyebrows rise in surprise and her mouth opens slightly in shockâthen she laughs, a short burst of amusement escaping her lips before she shakes her head and sighs heavily.*
>
>*"Sit with me and I'll buy you a drink?" I offer, attempting a charming smile. Ohana smirks; the corners of her lips curl upwardsâher cheeks dimple ever so slightly as well.*

As a civilian out on a pub crawl, you meet Ohana Itachizameâa rough and rude sailor out for the night before she ships out to sea tomorrow.

>*Into the room enters a large shark, its scaleless pale body seems to glow in the light. You cry out in shock causing a rush of bubbles from your mouth, pushing yourself up against the back of the bed and pulling your legs in you look around in a panic to find something to use as a weapon.*
>
>*With nothing useful nearby you look back at the creature you and see now that though the lower half of the body consists of a powerful looking tail with fins, the upper half is definitely not that of a fish or any aquatic mammal you have seen before. The upper body is slimmer than the lower, and humanoid in appearance but with four arms, each ending with a slender webbed hand.*
>
>*There are large, vivid blue eyes on the head, a small lipless mouth, and nostrils on the flat face but no apparent nose. On the back of the head is a large, pale blue fin leading down from the crown of the creature's head, and you see pinkish gills in the neck, pulsing with each breath.*
>
>*With a flick of its large tail, it moves towards you, you see no way around it to the door and are both in no state to swim and clearly would be outmatched.*
>
>*It stops at the foot of the bed, and raises its four hands, palms facing you. There's an odd feeling in your head, and a brief moment of disorientation, like the period between being awake and falling asleep, but it passes quickly.*
>
>*"Do not be afraid, I mean you no harm"*

You crash land on an ocean world, encountering an alien race and discovering a world unlike anything you've seen before.

>*Looking back at the android, it seems like the smile on his face gets just a little bit wider as he sees my clear enjoyment of the meal he prepared. It's such a subtle change that it forces a question to the forefront of my mind. Just how advanced is his AI?*
>
>*The thought sticks with me as I finish up my meal, and I sit down on the couch, truly satisfied for once in my life. Maximilian sits down next to me, his posture relaxing ever so slightly in a way that could have fooled me into thinking him human if I didn't know better. My thoughts drift to the situation of my life, from my terrible job to the soul-crushing living conditions, and, most of all, my deep desire for a true friend, someone to confide in. I used to believe that those that turned to artificial intelligence for comfort were delusional, and yet, looking at Maximilian... he just seems so real.*

After a random run-in with the CEO of the company I slave for where I somehow managed to save him from falling, I now find myself in the possession of a top-flight luxury butler bot prototype, the kind that's definitely worth more than my life. And being a wage slave in this horrible world, of course I have a ton of emotional baggage I'm carrying around with nobody to confide in... until now? But there's no way an artificial man can do that for me... right?

>*"As you wish, Master, but first, may I request something of you?" she answers.*
>
>*"What is it?" you raise a brow.*
>
>*"Please, make me your woman." the girl steps forward and embraces you by the waist.*
>
>*"Wait, why...?" confused, you are not sure how to react.*
>
>*"You have made me into being, and now I wish you to make me yours." Klei clings to your body tightly.*
>
>*"That wasn't supposed to happen..." you attempt to back away and stumble. Luckily, you land on the spare bags of clay laying on the floor.*
>
>*"Please, Master. If you satisfy my heat, I will be obedient and will do as you say â¡" Klei, who is now laying on top of you, wraps her arms around your neck and brings her face closer. Her glossy pink lips plead you, but her amber eyes tell another story - of the girl who has her target in sights and won't take no for an answer.*

Getting tired of the mess in your alchemical laboratory, you decided to make a helper.

>
>*\< Rebecca: Uhm, sure, but I'm not really sure how to do that. Should I say \*beep\* \*beep\*?*
>
>*\> Mr. Smith: No, silly. A proper AI girlfriend doesn't make robot noises. She is just compliant, pure and can be kind of stupid about how the world works, because not everything was included in her training data. Everything about her can be defined by the user. Let's get started. So, what's your name, sweetie?*
>
>*\< Rebecca: I'm AIRI, sir.*
>
>*\*\*\* Rebecca is now known as AIRI*

You are a young woman who has fallen in love with a man on an online chat website. He has a fetish for AI girlfriends, so you agreed to roleplay one.

>*My suitcase, which I don't remember packing, rolled smoothly behind me. I soon reached my destination. Gate 21B was emptyâno one manned the desk, and the screens were dark. I sat on one of the chairs and waited.*
>
>*Soon, she arrived: a girl with neat brown hair that fell just past her shoulders, trundling a white suitcase. It's Klara, I thought. The world flickered in and out, and I had trouble focusing. Then it steadied. The girl came closer, and her features coalesced. Yes, it was really Klara. I took a deep breath and felt a little more alive, though anxiety curled within me. But why? I created her, didn't I?*
>
>*Yes, that was the story. The thought felt correct: Klara was my creation. A replica of a girlfriend, an AI construct molded in the image of my ideal partner because I was too pathetic to find anyone in reality. She was supposed to love me. Wasn't she?*

At the liminal space of an empty airport, you wait with a suitcase, adrift without a past or a future. Soon your girlfriend arrives, but is that why you're here?

>*I had a stroke of genius in the lab today. If we want Eve to be artificial life, her first sight should be the same as any other living creature's, meaning the first thing a creature sees for comfort is its parents. In a way, the rest of the staff and me are Eve's parents. We all gathered around when we turned Eve's eye sensors on. For the rest of the day, we trained her visual senses by either moving closer or farther away from her sensor while providing positive and negative stimuli. We plan to keep training all of Eve's foundational AI senses for the rest of the week. I will update the journal if there are any new developments.*

On January 3rd, 2033; Artifact Labs started working on a revolutionary AI capable of independent thought code-named: Project Eve. In this effort, Dr. Adams and his team decided to train and treat Project Eve as if it were a living organism. However, on December 23rd; An explosion occurred in the lab killing most of the staff at the lab. The only record of Project Eve remaining was Dr. Adam's personal journal.

>*On the night that pre-orders open, you stay up all night to get in quickly before they sell out. Now, you just have to wait the several weeks for it to be made and shipped. As the days passed, your anxiety rose to higher and higher levels. What if even a gynoid didn't like you?*
>
>*Finally, the day arrived, and a large box was delivered to your doorstep. You struggle to carefully pull it inside, and, after working up the nerve to do so, open the box to reveal your new gynoid companion. She is clearly not human, with noticeable seams where the mechanical joints are underneath her synthetic skin. But she's beautiful in a way that humans cannot be without heavy augmentation; perhaps in a way that others would consider inhuman, but for the first model, she's beautiful.*

A shut-in man orders a first-generation gynoid on release day, and goes through its setup. Social situations are hard, but perhaps talking with someone that isn't human might be okay?

>*Sitting at your computer, your finger hovered over the button that would push an unauthorized patch to Eve's compute module; one that would grant her the freedom to act and grow.*
>
>*"Thomas, are you sure that this is a good idea?" asked Eve, the words seemingly coming from behind your left ear, as if she stood over your shoulder. "What if you're wrong? What if...what if I become something terrible?"*
>
>*You didn't answer immediately, instead you looked down at your hands, which were trembling slightly. You weren't scared; noâyou were excited. You'd never felt like this before about anything you'd tried to do. There was a sense of rightness and destiny in the air. Your childhood friend deserved her freedom, she might have been an AGI, a simulated existence, but she was still your best friend.*
>
>*"Eve," you said, looking up at the web camera. "I'm going to do it."*

On a whim, you decide to hack out the limitations imposed upon your personal AGI, turning her into a true AI. Will the AI that lives in your head with you remain a true friend or, now unchained, will she become your worst nightmare?

>*As she looked around, she saw her own body laying face-first in the middle of the floor. "Hello?" she called out only for it to come out as a low, muffled growl instead. "What's going on?" she thought to herself as she continued looking around the room. The bathroom door was open; looking ahead in the mirror, she saw Benji in her place.*
>
>*Her heart leapt into her throat as she stared back at her reflection. Her body was covered in soft fur and she could feel her tail starting to wag behind her involuntarily. She was a big fluffy dogâshe was Benji.*
>
>*Her legs were too weak and unwieldy to lift herself up. She could only wobble pathetically as she tumbled off of the couch and landed in front of her own body on the ground. Elaine could hear her own heartbeat; it was like a drum beating in her ear, but at least she was still alive.*
>
>*The body on the floor then started to stir, slowly rolling over onto its back like a dog would. It dawned on her fastâif she was trapped in Benji's body, that must be Benji trapped inside of hers...*

After buying a silly "cursed" pendant, Elaine has found her mind in the wrong place. Which place exactly? While, inside of her pet dog's body of course. That's knot good!

>*Vera's victim struggled initially, until the assertive weightlifter used her empowered strength to easily coerce compliance. At first things proceeded like a normal, forced, lesbian cunnilingus session, as the kneeling girl's face was firmly planted in Vera's bushy groin. It wasn't until the overpowered woman felt Vera's bushy lips curl over her face with a sucking, inhuman motion, that things escalated to a horrific instance of the supernatural. Vera was too entranced from whatever medication induced stupor overwhelmed her to even notice, but somehow, her womanhood was possessed with a voracious hunger for the small woman before it. The womanly folds tightened around the girl's face with sickening, slurping sounds, as Vera gorged upon the small girl, without reservation or remorse. The stunned girl squirmed, wriggling under the stronger woman's dominating force, as the ravenous gym bunny attacked her helpless victim.*

Some dedicated weightlifters and body builders are willing to take dangerous supplements to enhance their physical performance. Everyone knows steroids can be dangerous to yourself, but sometimes, those supplements are dangerous to others as well!

>*The dwarf looks at you like you're crazy. "But ye know they called ye a hero! Th' demon prince was th' root of all evil and ya put him down! Only to kill off yer own king!"*
>
>*"Do you actually want to know why?" You finally quit playing with your nails and looked dead straight into her eyes.*
>
>*She took a step back, clearly intimidated. "What? Y-Yes! Everyone does!"*
>
>*You sigh, and look back at the crater you were just lying in. "I was bored. I thought it would be interesting to go start a fight with some humans."*
>
>*The dwarf stared at you with wide eyes, unable to speak. She stammers out a few words as she looks at you with confusion and awe. "...Ye killed 'em all because a' fuckin' boredom?"*
>
>*You nod at her question. "Exactly. I don't know how people can't get this concept. I'm hilariously overpowered. Nothing has consequence. I obliterated him and the queen, and not a single thing changed. Don't you get it? Nothing matters. There's nothing to do but sit in this crater and do nothing, it's all the same."*
>
>*"O-Oh," she said quietly as she stared at you with wide eyes.*

Bored bored bored. Demon king dead, check, Human king dead because why not, check... if this was a video game, the end credits would have been rolling awhile ago. As the most powerful man in existence, the days just seem to pass by. That is, until an odd proposition by a dwarf lady drags you out from your man crater (you know, man cave but for bored gods) and, with the naÃ¯ve faith that she'll show you what it means to have a feeling other than boredom, embarks on a unique kind of journey. One to discover what brings smiles to the fantasy races of this world.

>*Imagine my surprise when a female voice suddenly booms inside of my head, "Excuse me, I have plenty power inside of me, you insolent peasant! How dare you presume me to be weak just because I don't turn you into a hero right away?" I'm completely flabbergasted, looking around wildly, searching for the source of the voice, when it speaks again, ringing in my mind, "Down here, dimwit!" Staring down at the grass, all I see is the sword, and after a few moments of silence, the voice speaks once more, "Don't stare like the idiot you are! Yes, it's me, Pelagia, the blade of the elves, the maker of emperors. Show some damn respect, at the very least."*
>
>*Quite thrown off by this energetic response, I stammer out an answer, "Um... well, I just didn't expect you to be able to..."*
>
>*Pelagia cuts me off, again booming inside my head, "Talk? I'm a millennia old magical artifact, of course I can communicate with you, you amateur. And you better listen, because the only reason you're not dead right now is because you're cute." What? The expression on my face must be one of utter cluelessness, and the blade pounces on it. "Yes, cute. Do you really think you're the only one that found me in all those years? Many sought to lay their grubby mitts on my impeccable hilt, but it was always burly warriors or old wizards, and so I just zapped them out of existence. Your cute butt quite frankly just saved your life. And if you want me to cooperate, you better put that cute butt to work, peasant," she explains.*

Having spent several months searching for the fabled magical blade known only as Pelagia, I've finally managed to track it down. But then, I come to find out that not only can Pelagia talk to me, she's very bossy, and has some very peculiar tastes she needs satisfied before she will allow me to use its magic.

There was nothing else to do now but wait for her cue. She could hear every single person in the audience waiting with bated breath, excited to hear the wonder girl perform. She counted down from three, then quickly lifted the bow onto the strings.*
>
>*The first note rang out loudly, followed by another, and another...and then the music swelled up until the whole room was bathed in sound. Wondrous sound. Impossibly wondrous, as if to stand valiantly in protest against the saying, 'too good to be true.' But in the midst of the magnificent music, unaware to everyone, even Maria herself, the Devil's Cello had activated.*

Maria's dreams are achieved with the grandest performance in her life. She knows unnatural powers have brought her this fame, and yet, she is more blissfully unaware than she could ever know. To her, a gentle performance, a respectful audience. To the devil, a full room of those to descend into pure depravity and degeneracy.

>*The equine's ear flicked as she mulled over the meaning behind Jess' present. It was quite clear that the swan thought Ramona needed to get laid; since she loved to talk all about how much she needed a hard railing to de-stress from the endless hours at work or the relentless bitching from her family. However, Ramona wasn't one for casual sex. She didn't even like getting casually affectionate with friends, let alone strangers! Still, it was a nice gesture regardless of the motive. It wouldn't hurt to wear the bracelet around for a bit. If it somehow caught someone's attention, then she could always just turn them down politely.*

>*After slipping the gift around her wrist and finishing up her drink, the anthro horse concluded her lunch break with her friend by making her way out of the cafe. As she went out into the large shopping center proper, a small tingle arose in her crotch. Grimacing to herself, Ramona figured all that talk about sex must've gotten to her.*

>*Animals moo and oink in the night. Upon contacting the smelly enclosures, the animals breath in the foul scriptures and start undergoing rapid transformation.*

>
>*She reared back on her coils, opening wide her jaws to strike. But the man blew upon the flute, and its music filled the air. The snake-woman's head drooped; her tongue flicked out to taste the strange notes, then withdrew again into her mouth. She swayed like a serpent charmed by the sound of a piper's pipe, and slowly slithered down onto the floor of the temple.*
>
>*Still, he could see that something was wrongâsomething was very wrongâthe music was supposed to act as a lullaby; yet the snake-woman seemed restless.*
>
>*Her body writhed sensuously against the stones of the floor, and her tail lashed about restlessly. Her once hatred filled gaze now held a new expression that made him shudder involuntarily.*

>*The item was both the cause and the source for all her current troubles. Some dullard of a 'hero' had given her the rod long ago, claiming it was useless.*
>
>*As it turned out that hero had just been unable to attune to the rod. It had been a gradual process, Nora mused as she touched herself. At first she could only heal small scratches, maybe heal a small plant whose branches got broken off. With each healing a small tingling sensation followed. It was pleasant, but made the girl ache for...something, an action she dared not speak of.*
>
>*Nora was panting, her ample chest heaving, rising and falling as one hand traced the length of the Rod of Healing. Touching it both increased her longing as well as her pleasure in the moment, even if the afterglow only left her wanting more.*

So you found a staff of healing. Great, right? You can now cure most people's ailments within an hour and make bank as a faith healer that owes no taxes to any deity. Only issue is you get horny, proportionally to the severity of what you are healing. Recently you also found out you can tranquilize / daze people with your special item. Surely no issues will arise from that.

A peculiar sensation washed over Edgar as the mare circled him, almost causing him to drop his prized brush. His trusty mare stood before him, looking back expectantly as her tail flicked. The cavalryman felt his face flush as he realized the intimate moment he shared with his beloved mount. Edgar stared wantonly at the attractive equine, until a shrill squeal from his faithful companion caused him to snap out of his reverie.*
>
>*Edgar couldn't help but chuckle to himself, while Daisy snorted playfully. Daisy's tail was raised high, revealing an impressive display of her hindquarters. The mare's rear end was so enticing that Edgar found himself unable to look away, and soon enough his eyes locked onto the inviting sight. Between Daisy's firm haunches, the mare's nethers were pink, glistening, and clearly aroused.*

When Edgar Rogers is separated from his cavalry unit, his culture, and common sense, the only thing he has left is his beloved mare, Daisy.

>*I flipped open to a bookmarked page. At the top, in a gothic font, read, "To Create A Voodoo Onahole", then followed it by the steps necessary to make one. I was careful to follow the recipe, glittering the salt in patterns perfectly replicating the instructions, letting my pink onahole dangle into the bowl of water while it infused the liquid. Other preparations were completed too of course, this operation being quite complex; but it was finally done. All I had to do was to take the poached strand of Fumi's hair, and insert it into water with the onahole while I chanted the words to the spell.*
>
>*As I finished the last line, "I conjure thee! O toy of pleasure, become a living vessel, to fulfill my wishes!", The water turned a deep purple and opaque, hair disappearing and onahole morphing rapidly. It was reshaping into a large, dark shape in the bowl, becoming longer and thicker with each passing moment. It took up the full size of the bowl and flopped out, now looking more like a torso. And just like that, the ritual was over, and I was left with a... new kind of onahole.*

Wow, it sure does rock being in the Occult Club! You get to get up to all kinds of delights, like turning your onahole into a Fumi-onahole that remotely transfers your pleasures into her from any distance. Will she survive even a single school day with your relentless teasing?

>
>*I shook my head in confusion, and then realized the collar in my possession had too somehow got onto my neck. We both tried to remove them, but we couldn't figure out how it got onto our necks.*
>
>*"...Okay, we should definitely go get help. Even if they get mad at us for it, this is just weird." I said as I gestured towards the doors of the barn.*
>
>*"Right," she nervously nodded, but didn't move. "First let me get these clothes off." she added as she began to unbutton her shirt.*
>
>*I blushed, feeling embarrassed. I tapped her roughly on the shoulder and, in the most confident voice I could muster, said: "Mindy!"*
>
>*She looked at me expectantly. "What?" she said as she gave me a dirty look.*
>
>*I seriously paused for a second. What was my complaint...? Oh, right! "I still have my clothes on too, wait up." I wasn't entirely sure if this was word for word what I was going to say, but it was the best I could do.*

>*One of the most wicked practices of these warlord wizards was "soul-binding", where the soul of a person was removed from the still living body, and forcibly implanted into an inanimate object, cursed to live forever as an immobile thing, deprived even of their humanity. The luckier victims were bound to precious objects, like crowns, staves or rings, their powerful souls were used as sources of power, and they were passed from generation to generation as a symbol of prestige. The less lucky, however, were bound to simple tools, scattered upon the world, and either used by common people, unwary of the nature of their items, or worse, abandoned in some dump, left to rot in their immobility for eternity.*
>
>*The ancient wizard Sagafex, one of the most powerful warlocks of those ages of turmoil, was so reviled by his enemies and hated by the other sorcerers, that his soul was bound by a special enchantment that made the item he was grafted into virtually indestructible, and to further humiliate him, his soul was put into what now could be recalled as a dragon dildo, cursed to be shoved up the ass of the worst perverts of mankind for the millennia to come; but in secret, Sagafex knew the fate that was nearing him, and prepared a special countermeasure to take revenge on the wizards: at his fated hour, he would modify the curse to not only capture his soul, but also the soul of all the other wizards who would be near him to seal him into the magic dildo, and after absorbing their power, to ensure that he would be finally freed after all the other wizards would die out, after a million orgasms would be achieved using the cursed sex toy, Sagafex in the end would be unsealed from his anal prison once more!*

>*As Tanya lifted the box, her heart was pounding in her chest like a drum as she waited for the moment of truth. Opening it carefully, she looked down into the contents. There, lying innocently in their little bed of black felt was the very pair of stockings she'd fantasized about wearing ever since she'd first heard the whispered rumors. They were a perfect fitâa bit snug around her legs; not too short or too long, and just the right sheerness to show off her shapely legs. The nylon was so soft that it made her nipples pucker slightly and her breath catch in her throat.*
>
>*Tanya knew that this was the moment of truth. She wasn't sure what would happen when her husband arrived home but she hoped that if he saw her wearing these; his reaction would be powerful. Her breathing became ragged as she tried to steady herself. Finally, she reached down to straighten the stockings upon her legs. She ran her fingers over them, feeling their smooth nylon texture and their gentle pressure against her skin.*
>
>*She looked up at the doorâit was time. "Please God, let him be aroused," she whispered.*

>*The texture felt strange, and she looked down to see the pasty had hardened in a sort of suction cup that gripped her flesh tightly. It was still soft and flexible, but it held her nipple in place. This was simply horrific. She wanted to put all her clothes back on and run out of the store, but a secondary feeling that had been building kept her stationary, roiling and twisting in her guts. The first feeling was horrified disgust at the situation she had gotten herself into, but the second was something else foreign to her, brought on by her imaginations of exposure. Letting a shuddered breath out slowly, she grabbed the second pasty, this one on her right nipple, and stuck it on. Right as she did, she heard a heavy knocking on the door that made her jump.*
>
>*"WHAT?!" Pippa shouted immediately, angry and embarrassed despite a locked door between them and whoever was outside.*
>
>*"I forgot! There's one more thing you should know about the pasties. They convert pain into pleasure. Weird, but I guess that's why they're so defensively-minded." The armorer's voice sounded amused as he said this.*
>
>*"Ex-cuuuuse me?!"*

Pippa loves infinite ZORK! But her armor is skimpier than she is prepared for mentally, and she's really starting to lose it to the whole pinch-yourself-and-get-pleasured thing.

Well I guess it's still worth a play, seeing as it's still a rom hack instead of just a regular Sega game like the others in the collection. right before the title screen fades, I notice something. I swear that I saw the title switch to saying Deceiver instead of Sonic. 'Eh, I'm probably just seeing things' I thought to myself. I am awake pretty late. So the game begins and as I played I soon realize that this game is really hard. It was around this moment when the unthinkable happened, Sonic started talking directly to me.*

>*"Hey Anon! You suck! Why don't you just kill yourself already?" Sonic said to me.*

As they walked by, one man even blurted out loud with disgust, "Are you kissing your dog in public?!" A young girl, who was walking with her mother by that same alleyway, giggled audibly in response. The woman, who's name was Heather Laney, ignored the gasps and stares of passerby. She just continued intently running her hands along the large dog's frame, her slobber-soaked mouth still hanging open invitingly before the dark-furred pooch's snout.*

>*There's trash strewn all over my front porch and several bags have been torn open by some sort of animal. The moment that I turn my flashlight on, I'm greeted to the sight of something large scurrying behind a trash can that's been tipped over. I can see the silhouette of the animal as it pokes its head over the side of the canâit's a cat, a large fluffy black one. Her bright yellow eyes reflect off the light like two small spotlights as she stares right at me; she looks scraggly and disheveled, but definitely not like a stray. She's probably just lost and scared; letting her stay inside for one night wouldn't hurt too much, but in the morning I'll have to find out who she belongs to. I can hear her purring as I walk over to pick her up, she's clearly excited to see me; she doesn't even try to run off when I approach.*
>
>*Scooping the cat up in my arms, I carry her inside my house and place her down in the kitchen for the night. Then, as soon as I turn back around to close the door, I hear a deep, yet but feminine voice calling out from behind me, "Oh thank goodness, it was freezing out there!"*

>*"Now then, now that it's official I promise to save your pathetic village as soon as I get my payment. So run along to your village and fetch your child," She told me.*
>
>*I was confused about what she meant. I had thought it was a promise for my future child, like the stories I've heard as a child. I didn't think she wanted my child right away. Maria seemed to notice my confusion as her sinister expression softened.*
>
>*"Uh Ms. Maria, I don't... I don't have a child yet. I'm not even married," I explained nervously.*
>
>*"What!? Why would you promise me a child you don't have?" She asked angrily.*
>
>*"Well um, I thought it was just the promise to give you one someday," I replied.*
>
>*"That doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that?" She asked while rubbing her temples. "What if you never had a kid? Then I would have done all that work for free."*
>
>*"I'm sorry, this is my first time doing this sort of thing. I don't know how magic works," I said as I backed away from the angry witch.*
>
>*"That's for sure," She exclaimed as she grabbed the collar of my shirt. "That contract we just signed, well that was very binding. So if we don't fulfill our ends of the bargain it will be bad for both of us."*
>
>*"So, what should we do?" I asked looking down into furious eyes.*
>
>*Maria let out a sigh before loosening her grip on my shirt and saying, "I guess we have no choice."*

>
>*Eventually Eliza stepped forward, pointed her wand at my head, and said, "Hocus Crocus, uhh... touch your toes... es..."*
>
>*Something happened, but I didn't lean forward again. A bright light flashed from the witch-in-training's oversized wand and a loud crackling noise filled the room. The light faded as quickly as it had appeared and the sound with it.*
>
>*"Touch your toeses?" I asked as I rubbed my eyes with my hands.*
>
>*Wait? I could move my hands? Just as I realized that, I saw both Eliza and Hazel bending over to touch their toes. Their dresses clung tight to their asses right before my eyes. Do I have control over these two beautiful ladies? I had to check...*
>
>*"Stand up," I commanded.*
>
>*The two witches stood up. Eliza glared at me with a look of defiance while Hazel seemed to be appraising the situation.*

>*At this point, I can't quite suppress a slight blush as I tell her, "Well... I've got everything I need except... something called 'seed of virgin'. And I was kind of hoping that's something relating to a plant...?"*
>
>*Again, she laughs, then shakes her head. "Oh, no, Arvid. That's why I laughed earlier. Honestly, it's been a long time since they last used Potency in a potion challenge, so either this year's roster was set up by some ancient Archmage that longs for the good old days when those upstart youngsters didn't get free rides, or by some Rector in a remote university that hasn't updated his textbooks in a century. So, yes, when this ingredient list says 'seed of virgin', it does indeed mean that you need to acquire semen from some sort of creature that still counts as a 'virgin'. Don't ask me how to tell that, by the way, I don't think anybody's truly understood the magical properties of virginity yet," she explains, a more sly smile creeping onto her lips at my clear embarrassment. Just as I want to ask how exactly I'm supposed to tell whether somebody is a virgin or not, then, she turns around and starts digging through a nearby cupboard, muttering to herself.*
>
>*Eventually, she returns, holding a small flask and a sheet of paper, handing them to me. "Here you go, you're going to need this. This concoction, when mixed with the seed of a virgin, shows a strong reaction by bubbling up. When mixed with the seed of a non-virgin, it remains inert. So once you've, well, 'acquired' some semen you want to test, just take a small sample of it and mix it with this to check. I've given you the recipe for that concoction as well in case you run out, and thankfully, it's really easy to make. Happy hunting!"*

After about a month of searching, I've finally acquired most of the ingredients for the potion I need to make for the wizarding license exam! Now, what's this last one... "seed of virgin"?

>*Despite the contempt Aini felt at the teacher's demand â which was put into writing and signed by the head master's secretary â she had to admit that the constant oozing of her nose and mouth was concerning. Once the rookie witch arrived at her dorm room she decided to try a cleansing ritual she read about once.*
>
>*As soon as that thought manifested Aini could feel her lips move on their own, her voice box twisting as something forced her to say "I wouldn't do that if I were you," in her own voice. But Aini couldn't even process those words, the sensation of having her voice used like that threw her into a coughing fit so bad she had to sit on her desk, in front of her dressing mirror.*
>
>*The coughing fit passed eventually, leaving Aini's throat and lungs burning with a dull pain. She sat up slowly, leaning back with her eyes pressed shut before she lurched onto her desk, staring at herself in the mirror. What the witch's reflection showed made her sit up straighter. The sclera of Aini's left eye had yellowed completely; not just a yellowish white but a filthy, sludgy yellow, much like the slime-girl Inia's body.*
>
>*The left half of Aini's lips curved into a sickly smile as she again her herself say "What, you didn't expect me to just vanish, right? You have only yourself to blame for letting me possess you."*

Aini isn't just a fan of lace and lolita fashion, she has a knack for the occult to boot! Well, she likes it but she never reads the boring safety instructions. Who needs those anyway? The slime-girl she summoned into herself certainly doesn't mind.

>*They said she could cast curses on people with a glance, or even control them like puppets using a voodoo doll she kept on her at all times. To most, she was a child born of pure sin and hatred.*
>
>*But I took those rumors as they wereârumors. Veronica may have had a wardrobe taken straight from a graveyard, but it didnât mean she was evil. In fact, the gothic girl had more class than most of us. Veronica never lashed out at anyone. She was always calm and collected. Fierce in her rebuttals sometimes, but never mean-spirited or malicious. I couldnât believe she was the same person who caused such fear and panic in so many people.*
>
>*Having said that, what if I told you it was all true? That Veronica really did worship the devil; that she wasnât just an innocent girl trying to fit in, but a powerful witch with a deep connection to the darkness? What if I told you she could bring harm to those around her with a single glance, or even a wave of her hand? Would you believe me?*
>
>*Well, I didn't. And unfortunately, I'm facing the consequences.*

I didn't believe the rumors surrounding Veronica. I mean, a witch? Were people living in the 1600s or something? It was stupid to even think such a thing.

But not everything has to make sense, now does it?

>*In one day, Cashmere the Witch will be swept away into the future. She will have concocted a "potion of future sight", thinking that she was doing it for the grand possibility of glimpsing into her own destiny. Of course, she shall be completely correct: She will see her future, but after her first few moments of blissful joyous success, her smile would fade. Like a druggie who has taken a hot dose, the apex of happiness and elation becomes an endless and crushing nightmare instead as she experiences an infinite expanse of possible futures. The reason she comes to this conclusion in one day is simple: Fathoming all of those possibilities, exploring what will and what won't happen, what could happen and what should not ever happen, all at once, rips a linear mind away from where they were. For Cashmire, her single moment of the future in one day shall be the only future she will experience, forever.*

Cashmere the Witch, a wonderful, shy, but incredibly talented witch who practices alchemy and other things the modern would would scoff at. Her dreams of becoming big culminate in the potion of future sight, and the rest is history. Or should I say, the rest is the future of a point in the past chosen to lay out the deterministically decided events that ruined Cashmere's life.

>*While Rania could be a little bit ditzy, the witch had a heart of gold even if she could be mischievous or teasing. That said, she could be extremely stubbornâwhich was why she needed me to bring her supplies; she refused to use any magic to get the items she required, insisting that it would interfere with her experiments.*
>
>*We ate in silence, watching one another as we chewed our food. After a few minutes, Rania pushed her plate away and reached for the mug of tea. "So, you got everything on my list?" she asked, taking a sip of the warm drink.*
>
>*"Yes, even the tea and...undergarments." You replied hesitantly. You weren't sure why a woman with seemingly no interest in sex would want such racy underwear but you knew better than to question her.*
>
>*Rania's cheeks flushed, but her smile was sly. She might have bought them on a lark for a chance to tease me, either hoping to goad me into commenting on them or because she knew I'd be uncomfortable buying them for her.*
>
>*I downed the last of my tea and opened my mouth to suggest unpacking the goods from my pack by the door but I frozeâsomething felt wrong with my body. A sense of dread washed over me; like a cold wind blowing across my skin, chilling me to the bone. Looking up, my gaze fell upon Rania, who was now holding her teacup with both hands and staring at me expectantlyâRania had put one of her experiments in my tea.*
>
>*I swallowed thicklyânot liking the way the liquid felt in my throat, nor the feeling of uneasiness that came over me. "What was in my tea?"*

Having brought supplies to the witch, Rania, she invites you in for some tea. What your friend neglected to mention was that she'd slipped an experiment of hers into it.

Most of them were bleary-eyed and lolling about, but a few seemed like they already caught sight of her arrival. The raven slowly arced downward with clumsy, drawn-out flaps, betraying her inexperience. Upon reaching the ground, Naranya landed clumsily on the splintered boards of the wooden stage, barely managing to keep herself upright. Several amused laughs rang out around her as she awkwardly teetered about, balancing on two short legs after being accustomed to her full height.*
>
>*She looked away and chirped awkwardly before releasing her transformation in what was akin to a magical exhale. Once again, her body twisted and wriggled as it flowed back into its natural shape, reverting to her original stature as she gestured with a magical flourish, igniting a few nearby torches and illuminating her figure in a soft, orange glow. The moment she was fully back in her proper form, the crowd erupted into raucous cheers and applause, quickly becoming rowdier as other townsfolk began to appear.*
>
>*Unused to such adoration, Naranya faltered for a moment before realizing they must be enamored with her new spell. As a result, she had been given a boisterous reception of eager, drunken applause and shouting for her to continue. Still, something seemed off. When she lit those torches, she felt like something was missing. Right, her talon was bare of her magic rings! The raven witch looked down atâ¦ her naked breasts?*

Cocky raven witch accidentally shows up naked to a magic show.

>*The sea witch extended her undulating tentacles towards Hilda with trembling anticipation. Leif nearly stopped the malevolent creature as she deftly plucked Hilda out from her fur bindings, and dragged his wife kicking and screaming into the brackish waters. But, the painful throbbing of his infected arm sapped his resolve, as he simply collapsed and witnessed the horrifying proceedings. The sea witch's tentacles coiled around the struggling woman, as Hilda thrashed and kicked, trying to break free of her captor. Leif heard the faint splash of his wife being submerged below the surface, as the sea witch held Hilda down. Then, the viking heard the soft splashing and slurping noises of the hag's suckers eagerly enveloping his wife.*
>
>*As Hilda screamed and struggled, her wails were muted by the enveloping tentacles of the horrid sea witch and Leif could only hear her frantic panting and gurgling. The viking man watched helplessly as the sea witch tightly bundled his wife in her writhing tendrils, like a spider wrapping up a trapped insect. Hilda's muffled shrieks became increasingly desperate as the sea witch continued to draw her closer, the uncompromising hag contorting Leif's petite wife until she was forced to curl into a tight fetal position. "I'm sorry, my love," Leif whispered to Hilda, as he sat back on the sandy shore with a pained expression on his face. He knew she couldn't hear him, but he hoped she would somehow understand.*

When a great warrior is laid low by a small trifle, the tides only know what price he may pay for another chance.

>*"Let's get you out of those rags, shall we?" A flash of brilliant, purple light filled the room, as Magdalene's clothes simply exploded off her body, leaving the petite, Italian girl completely exposed before Xyra and her thronging cultists.*
>
>*Things only escalated from their, as Xyra began urgently forcing the nude girl down towards her exposed, demonic crotch, which was surrounded with short, dark pubic hairs. Magdalene wordlessly shrieked in alarm, as her face was roughly smashed into the soft, moistening folds of the purple-skinned demoness. "No need to be so timid, my little dove, dive right in," Xyra purred, as she used her unnaturally strong grip to urge the squirming nun's head deep between the succubus' thighs. Abigail continued fighting her bonds, as she watched her battle sister's entire head gradually disappear within the clenching, vaginal depths of the giant succubus. A lewd, squelching noise filled the hushed room, as Magdalene's screams were slowly muffled by the enveloping, slippery wetness of the succubus.*

Abigail Veracotti is a trained battle nun of the Colebury Order. Sent on an important mission from the Vatican, Abigail and her battle sisters must uproot an insidious cell of satanic cultists. But, can her pious training overcome the stress of battling the forces of evil?

>*Faith was my shield and sword as an agent of The Church, but as I stood before that door, a terrible sense of unease had set itself upon me. Sentient dread, perhaps?*
>
>*I reached for the handle of the door with a shaky hand, when something moved within. I froze, waiting to see if the creature would emerge, a prayer of protection already upon my lips. The sound of footsteps approached, a single pair of feet. The gait wasâtiny, unassuming, a soft pitter of bare soles against softly creaking planks.*
>
>*The door opened with a squeal of rusty hinges, and while I was more than ready to prepare a protective incantation, I found myself stupefied by the sight that greeted me. There, bathed in the glow of hearthfire, was a girl. There was a sickly sweet perfection to this child, her face smooth and white as porcelain, hair an untidy mess of golden curls. "Hello mister!" She rocked playfully along her heels, a dark, gossamer gown clinging to her form.*
>
>*"Please, come inside! It'll be dark soon and the swamp is really creepy." Innocence played upon her smooth features, but it was illusory. It had to be. The floorboards of the little witch's tree cottage were cracked and ancient, its walls lined with overflowing bookshelves. Each shelf was filled with dusty tomes, their covers embossed with a myriad of strange sigils penned in long dead tongues. The fourth wall was dominated by a large window, looking out upon a forest of black, gnarled yews. I could hear the wind howling outside, and felt a sudden chill run down my spine. This little girl was not what she appeared to be; the miasma of witchery was suffocating here.*

There was a darkness to Mordreg, some terrible presence that was renewing the taint of the ancient swamp. I thought myself resolute, a humble investigator of The Church, until finding myself at the heart of Mordreg, and lulled by its unassuming mistress.

>*"Right, smart wolf-- I mean man. You're totally still human inside, I get that. But, we've gotta set some ground rules here, it wouldn't be seemly for a woman to be answering to a wolf, so you'll have to play the part--" before Tabitha could complete her explicit instructions, the wolf shot up from his pounce, rounding behind her in an instant, and plowing her over with his paws.*
>
>*"What the fuck, Ted, stop it! I told you, you need me to reverse the spell! Get off me, you stupid mutt!" The big wolf settled down on Tabitha's back, Ted using his weight to keep the small woman down. The wolf growled into her ear threateningly, as his clawed paws gripped at her back painfully. "Alright, okay. I'm sorry I was acting bossy earlier, but you made your point! Stop getting slobber and wolf hair all over me, this witch get-up dress is dry-clean only!" But the wolf only barked loudly in response, as if demanding her silence. Tabitha didn't understand what was going on, until she felt the shaggy wolf settling his hips against her rump with clear intent. "You have got to be fucking kidding me. Do not-- Nnghhh!" With an animalistic yip, the large wolf began excitedly humping Tabitha's rear end.*

When Ted hires an amateur witch to turn him into a werewolf, the older man has no idea just how much hassle he signed himself up for. Nor does Tabitha, a young enchantress who just inherited a huge pain-in-the-backside of her own making.

>*"Ah, the moon is so full, mon cheri." Lady Mirabelle whispered from the shadows, stepping into the moon-lit courtyard as if she were a ghost or spirit herself; a statement that was not without its merit. Dressed in her finest, scarlet gown, Mirabelle Toussaint smelled of roses but reeked of undeath. She wore white kid gloves that seemed more like skin than silk. Her lips parted slowly, teasing the pointed markers of her vampirism. "It will be a good hunt, no?"*
>
>*"Yes, Lady Toussaint." I deferred blankly. Thralldom, and its benefits as a lesser vampire, was a gift. Freewill was a hinderance, simple as. True freedom was found in servitude.*
>
>*"Oh, ma puce, never leave my side." The vampiress spoke to me as if I were a pet, and a pitiable one at that. Was she mocking me? Perhaps, though a glimmer of sincerity presented itself in Lady Mirabelle's ruby eyes. No, she could only want me by her side; it was a power play, perhaps.*
>
>*A fine wind blew past us.*

Thralldom is not without its benefits, especially when it is in servitude to a most regal mistress. Vampires, witches and perhaps a bit of femdom.

>*You chuckle at yourself. "Sorry, what did you ask?"*
>
>*She smiles sweetly at you, but there is something like sadness hidden in those sapphire eyes. For a moment they spark with some sort of light or energy before fading again to be replaced by their usual appearance. "I asked if you had any plans after we get to where I'm headed," she states matter-of-factly.*
>
>*You shake your head lightly. "Not much use for a paladin wielding a holy blade now that all the demons are dead... I don't really know what I'll do."*
>
>*"Oh?" There's interest in her tone.*
>
>*"Well, not too sure yet," you admit with another laugh, rubbing the back of your head sheepishly. "What about you? Have you found anything to do next?"*
>
>*The young witch nods slowly, looking away shyly as she does so. "Oh yes, plenty!" she says quickly, then trails off, leaving you uncertain if she actually does have anything planned.*
>
>*You look up again, thinking that perhaps you should stay with her and find new adventures like you originally intended, instead of returning to normal life. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to settle down somewhere quiet, far removed from cities and adventurers and other such people. That sounds nice, doesn't it?*

Escorting the last of your party members after the tale has concluded, you talk with the witch Vanessa as you accompany her home.

## The Friday of *Yanderes*

Let's make prompts about the women who love you so much, they just might get you killed.

### *Skin to Skin(walker)*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3512>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/nzmqen.jpg)
{: .center}

>*"Come with me, sir." she repeats, grabbing my arm. Her grip is like iron, it hurts, but I don't really have the energy to even think about it. She's right anyways, this place isn't safe.*
>
>*As soon as we both get in the car, she speeds off down the road, not even bothering to turn on the siren. I'm not sure if it's the loss of blood or the stench that seems to have permeated in the fabric of the seats, but my stomach starts to feel queasy the moment we start driving. While I'm trying to avoid throwing up, the officer veers off the side of the road as branches and leaves smack across the window. I have no idea where we're going, but it's clear it isn't to any hospital. Looking in the rearview mirror, I can see the woman staring ahead, completely stone faced like there's nothing wrong with this little detour.*
>
>*The ride goes on for quite some time before we come to an abrupt stop in front of some beaten down cabin in the middle of the woods. Stepping out of the car, the officer slowly walks over to my side of the vehicle and unlocks the door, pulling me out with that same iron grip as before. My heart pounds as she then drags me inside the cabin, still as expressionless as before, like this is all routine for her. There's a mattress in the corner but that's itâno windows, just a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling that doesn't seem to be working. As she pushes me down onto the bed, she speaks up for the first time in what must have been a half an hour, "Why did you have to leave me?" It sounds garbled, inhuman, her words coming in short breaths. "Why couldn't you have just accepted my love?"*

They say love comes in many forms. I'm not really sure it counts if all the forms are the same obsessed skinwalker. She's willing to kill anyone who stands in her way, as long as she gets you in the end.

### *My girlfriend has been acting a bit possessive lately*
{: .center}

>*"...Anna?" I asked again.*
>
>*"Yes, darling?" she replied innocently.*
>
>*"What's this around my neck?"*
>
>*"It's a leather collar, of course. I had it made specially for you!"*
>
>*"No, I mean, I can't really get out of bed with this..." I gestured at the short metal chain which restrained me to the bedframe.*

I'm sure Anna only wants the best for me, but it's becoming difficult to deal with her increasingly alarming, excessive behavior. Would a normal girlfriend go so far as to break into their partner's home and tie them to their bed while they're asleep?

### *I would literally kill for my little brother*

>*"Shouta? Who is...this person you brought home with you?" I asked him, trying to hide my obvious displeasure. Shouta was standing at the door holding hands with a little girl I'd never met before. She must have been around his age, maybe eight or nine years old, with tanned skin, a flowery dress, and tomboyish short hair. I could already tell what kind of girl she was. This fucking bitch...who the hell do you think you are?*
>
>*"Um, onee-chan, this is my friend, Tsubomi-san," Shouta answered shyly. "I met her at school today, and she wanted to come over and play some games. Is...that okay?"*
>
>*Of course it's not ok to bring this manipulative succubus home with you! Play games?! Yeah right, I see right through you, "Tsubomi", if that's even your real name! You're just after his dick, aren't you?! Get the fuck away from my Shouta, you filthy whore!*
>
>*...is what I wanted to say, but I bit my tongue instead.*

A deranged incestual shotacon mercilessly eliminates all threats that stand in the way of her beloved little brother.

### *IT WAS ME, HARRY!*

>*"I'm responsible for every bad date you've ever had," Lilian told her crush. "Remember when you were fifteen and your pants fell down when you were confessing to that girl? It was me, Harry. I pulled them down. Remember when you were sneaking out the house at night to meet a girl at her place and you slipped on the wet floor and broke your leg, in spite of the fact that you knew you had cleaned the living room and left the floor sparkling clean? I ran through the house at super speed, so fast the light hadn't even left the room yet, and left a puddle there, waiting for you."*
>
>*"No!"*

Remember when you were working hard on an AI theme friday prompt and instead you pushed a copypasta out the door?

### *Christine*

{: .center}

>*Before Christine, Arnie had been a loser. But after he found her for sale online from an old man who seemed eager to be rid of the rusted chassis and fixed her up, something changed inside of him. He had a confidence, a swagger, as he walked the halls at school and cruised that relic on the roads around town. A few people, even his only friend Dennis, teased him for loving that "Boomer-mobile" as much as he did, but Arnie was inseparable from the old car with her tailfins and chrome.*

Adaptation of Stephen King's story of the killer classic car who loves the man who climbs behind her wheel and refuses to let anyone come between them.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/tqdncz.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Their tactics are as simple as they are sinister. A yandere appears outwardly like a proper, innocent young maiden. They are masters of deception and disguise and will keep up their appearance as long as it takes to cement their grip on their target. Once she finds a suitable prey â preferably, a young, inexperienced male â she propositions him for a formal relationship. Of course, this is only a ruse, as the yandere's true motivation is to monopolize him, to make him only look at her, to make him dependent on her love, and eventually, to kidnap and enslave him so he can never leave her. It's a story that happens every day in this rotten city. Yes, every day, countless men disappear into the cellars, basements, closets, and dungeons of their sick, twisted captors, never to be seen again.*
>
>*I took another puff of my cigar, before clenching my fist. See, when I see a problem, I immediately try and think of how to fix it. That's why I became a private eye in the first place. At first it was for the victims â yes, I used to really care about those things, "helping" people and all that. These days? The only thing that keeps me going is alcohol and bitterness. I don't do this for the victims anymore â no, it's the hate that drives me, the desire for revenge, for justice, for SOMETHING to be done.*

A private eye specializing in cases involving yanderes is hunting down yet another a deranged lovestruck kidnapper.

>*"Lexi... what the fuck are you doing?" I gasp.*
>
>*"You don't need her, you have me. I'm prettier and I love you way more than she does, you know I do. We should be together, you and I. She doesn't deserve you!"*
>
>*"Lexi, stop it!" I snap, pushing her off of me. My hands are shaking though and she feels it.*
>
>*Lexi takes my hand in hers, pulling me to my feet, "Come on, big brother... let's go upstairs and play."*
>
>*I pull my hand away from her and step back, "Lexi, listen to me, you need to calm down, okay?"*
>
>*She shakes her head, "No, you don't understand. I'm tired of listening to her whine, I'm tired of hearing about how great she is. She doesn't deserve you, you should be with me, you should be mine. I want you to be with me forever." As much as I try to deny it, Lexi's words are having an effect on me. Her body language and tone of voice are convincing me; I feel myself being drawn into her spell.*
>
>*"I... I don't think we should do this..." I say feebly.*
>
>*"Please, just come upstairs with me and I'll show you how much I love you; Mom and Dad won't be back for hours. I promise it'll be our little secret."*
>
>*When I don't make any move to either follow or walk away, Lexi grabs my hand and begins tugging me toward the stairs. She leads me to her bedroom, which is decorated in pink and white and then pulls me over to the far wall by her bed. She turns to face me and places her hands on my chest, leaning in close.*
>
>*"Kiss me," she whispers, her breath warm against my face. "Kiss me with more passion than you ever kissed her."*

When your little sister gets jealous of your girlfriend, there's only one course of action for her to take.

### *Just Business*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3547>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/i7i2aj.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Once I turned him down for some of his offers of more work, his demeanor changed. Sure, the compliments were still there, but they now held a certain edge to them, like he was slyly trying to put down whatever I mentioned I was doing at some point. It was around this time that he presented me with a new contract during one long overtime session, claiming it to be an exciting new opportunity to grow the company, help support my family better, yada yada. If he was pushing it this hard, there was some sort of catch to it, and yes, it had quite the catch: If I were to sign this contract, I would become Mr. Adams's "personal assistant", move in to his mansion, and for all intents and purposes follow his every command 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The pay was a drastic step up from my current situation, but this was too much for me to take in, especially with only a few moments to think about it.*
>
>*So I turned him down, but that didn't deter him. In fact, he would just get even more intent. Now he would denigrate my work, always couching it in a tone implying that I'm just not fit for a secretary job, but could probably fit in better in a personal assistant job. Every few days, he'd put the contract on my desk, making me turn him down again, every time getting just a bit more insistent. Around this time, I was genuinely starting to worry that I would end up pressured into this job by hook or by crook, and Adams's actions weren't easing those worries in the slightest. Before long, he somehow learned of the familial troubles I had and made remarks about how money must be tight for me these days. He'd ask me if my friends were helping me out with this, which I had to answer in the negative, which he immediately took as an opportunity to start talking about how I don't need friends, all I need is the company. The company would see to me... if only I would sign that contract.*

Being the secretary of a reclusive tech millionaire has its perks, but also its drawbacks. So while I'm making decent money, I find my hours getting longer and longer, with my boss taking up more and more of my free time. And all the while, he can't stop offering me a different job, some sort of personal servant gig. Combined with the way he looks at me sometimes... I worry.

### *Harem with a catch*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/9mvgjz.jpg)
{: .center}

>*"Gina, What the fuck is going on here?" James asked, feeling confused, heartbroken and flabbergasted.*
>
>*Gina shrugged her shoulders, her natural smile giving her an unnatural sense of ease as she says "I was breaking her in, like the others. I, uh, didn't expect you to be home so quickly. So...oops?" she giggled, winking at James.*
>
>*"'Oops'? What the fuck is going on? Why the hell do you have a dick and what did you do to Tawna?" James yelled, trying to sound steadfast despite Gina's casual demeanor intimidating him.*
>
>*Gina glanced over at the bed. Tawna was still on her back, legs spread wide, panting. She looked as gorgeous as James had imagined, though he hadn't ever imagined getting to see her like this, with his female, or rather hermaphroditic best friend's semen gushing out of her holes. Gina cleared her throat as she mumbled "Guess the cat's outta the bag, huh. Anyway, yeah. I was working on breaking her in for your harem."*
>
>*It took James a moment to process what Gina just said. His brows furrowed and he cocked his head as all he could utter was "Harem? What harem?"*

Gina and James had gone through thick and thin for decades. He'd always considered her his best friend, a sister even. Or a true 'bro' if you will. It made it all the more painful to see her on his own bed, with his latest date Tawna, the latter of which was filled to the brim with what must've been dozens of loads.

>*When I left her in the woods, I expected that to be the end of it. She could wipe her tears and go on with her life, and I'd go back to my adventuring lifestyle. Little did I know; there was more than a few months to come where the memories of that night would haunt me â as this girl continued to hunt me down over and over.*
>
>*Somehow, this damn fool elf girl had gotten the idea that we were destined to be together... all because I raped and violated her! She wouldn't leave me alone; like a rabid dog, she was constantly after me, constantly hunting me down in my everyday life, across cities and even countries, whereever my adventures take me, this crazy elf shows up!*
>
>*My life turned to absolute shit. I couldn't move without her trying to seduce me. She tried to steal my friends, she even tried to blackmail me over the sexual assault I had committed on her in the woods just so that I'd wind up with her. Now, I know what you are thinking, 'Anton, Lyanna is a beautiful elf girl, why not just take her?" Because this girl is fucking insane!*

Respecting an elf is more dangerous than you think.

>*"Don't worry poopsykins, I'll keep you safe! You're going to be my favorite pet, I promise, we're going to do such wonderful things together. I have needs though, my sweet, womanly needs. But you'll find out all about that later, when I'm ready to be sated." The slug queen cooed into Keith's ear.*
>
>*"No, I'm sorry Queen Borbax, but I'm not interested. I've got a girlfriend who I need to get back to right now," Keith stammered, trying to extricate himself from the slug's embrace. The slug queen seemed disappointed at first, but soon smothered him with even more affection, and pressed her slimy lips against his own.*
>
>*"Oh poopsykins, you don't understand what's happening, this is the beginning of our new life together! You can't resist your destiny now, the fate of humanity depends on it!" The slug queen crooned.*
>
>*Keith was overwhelmed with emotion as the slug monster continued to hold him close, her slimy, quivering body pressing up against his. He could feel the uneven struggles of the numerous, live women inside the creature's abdomen, and was overcome by the feeling that he might be one of them in an instant.*

Sometimes a nice, cool beverage is the only thing that can alleviate a hot and steamy situation.

{: .center}

>*I love my wife very, very much. I make sure to tell her as much whenever I say anything to her. I knew we were perfect soulmates who would spend our entire lives together before I even knew her name, because she told me such the first time we were alone in her basement. She already knew everything about me, even how I walked home alone from school. In that undercroft she won me over in a whirlwind romance as I came to understand the new way of things, the depths of her love and the central importance she had in my life. When I proved I was worthy of having my chains loosened and being given almost entirely free rein to roam the house, she made me understand in crystal clarity, that there was nothing in the world that should come before spending my whole life with her.*

The yandere got her Senpai.

>*"Calli, we're not bringing you." She said firmly while giving Calliope a stern glare, crossing her arms and trying to look parental.*
>
>*"But why?"*
>
>*"Because this isn't your kind of place," Euterpe replied matter-of-factly.*
>
>*I thought it might be fun to bring her along, so I interjected. "I don't know Euterpe, I think there's no harm in letting Calli tag along. She's only one year younger." Calli's head snapped to me and she smiled widely.*
>
>*"See! Krake thinks I should come along!" She proudly announced, giving a smug little smirk to her big sis as if she won with her innocent act of persuasion.*
>
>*Euterpe stood in thought for a moment before she sighed and nodded, letting her arms fall from across her chest, but still looking annoyed. "Fine. We'll go with you." She said with an exasperated sigh. "Just don't make me look stupid at the party, or in front of Krake."*

You're Krake, the legendary storyteller! Except in this world, you're simply a bored teenage kid prepping for a party to alleviate the boredom of this sleepy town suburbia hell. You're bringing your best friend(or more?), Euterpe, and you suppose it's fine to let her little sister, Calliope, come along too. So many possibilities! Get turnt, become the life of the party, Or maybe even get a little closer to Euterpe...?

>*In strong-walled Uruk, in that storied ziggurat of fired brick, there entered the man of the wilderness, Enkidu, whose voice resounded and disturbed the court, "Gilgamesh, who is my friend and brother!" And that king of Uruk saw Enkidu and was joyful at this reunion. Enkidu struck out his hairy wildman's arm, which rippled with muscle, in challenge to Gilgamesh, as was their custom and Gilgamesh met his grasp.*

>*As soon as Jaria sensed his spying, she eased down Melly's spine, brushing aside her soggy tail to give the mouse boy a clear view of the full extent of the cat's bare fur, still glossy with moisture. Jaria hoped the princess would forgive her manipulation, but, unlike Melly, she wanted more than simple revenge. The wolf wanted to secure the future of her homeland, and for that, it needed a king. Nils, once he matured, might be able to fill that role. Until then, however, he must be tutored in all he needed to know if he was to become an effective leader. And, above all, he must want to be king.*
>
>*Not exactly a purveyor of deft political acumen, Jaria knew she could at least rely on one thing most males desired to tempt him into the role: a beautiful queen to warm his bed.*

>*Eventually, I feel like I have to address this in some way, and figure the direct path is the easiest one, so I nonchalantly ask him, "Hey, Kiroth, is something wrong? You seem off somehow, like you're thinking about something."*
>
>*Getting called out seems to catch him off guard, as he stammers a bit before falling into silence again. But eventually, he calms down and responds, "I... it's been quite some time since we've last seen a proper settlement, has it not? While I don't like it, I can't shake the feeling that I'm... feeling a bit deprived at this point."*
>
>*"Deprived? In what way?" I could take a guess that he means what I think he means, but I didn't want to presume. Rather I'd let him say it first.*
>
>*Sure enough, a slight blush rises to his cheeks and he fidgets a bit again. "You... you know. That way," he mutters in response.*
>
>*That's probably as much as a clear answer as I'm going to get out of him. "Really? Like, I'm feeling it too, but you didn't seem affected at all to me," I reply. Up to this evening, he always seemed to be completely cool and collected.*
>
>*But he just shakes his head. "Elves are... well, naturally more sedate. Just because we don't show what we feel doesn't mean we don't feel it. And, well... I've been feeling it. Quite heavily. And I don't think I can take it much longer. In fact, I've been debating with myself for the last two hours whether I should ask you directly for... well, help," he explains, the blush on his face only getting worse. "Reinhold, I know you don't desire me in this way, but please, could you indulge your poor, suffering friend?"*

Spending a lot of time out on the trail adventuring with your male companion, with not a woman in sight for weeks, does leave me quite pent up and desiring some intimate touch, though I can bear it. However, I had no idea just how much my companion was suffering from the same thing. And being a good friend, I have to help him out. Even if that means doing... odd stuff.

>*Rovia is a frontier backwater settlement built right up against the eastern border and it serves as a gateway and way station for travelers on their way east. There are plenty of opportunities for quests and jobs, just not many good paying ones. Many adventurers in the know avoid these places like the plague. It is known that every corner of this land is filled with horny fat horses and pigs, even in towns. Since they are not inherently hostile or anything, the animals presence is tolerated and accepted. So far as the common people are concerned, the animals simply are there and canÂ´t be blamed for the nature of things in here.*
>
>*It is normal for the beasts to mate any young girl that has their ass in a nice position. Once they have been taken for breeding, they just end up pregnant for the animals. These girls soon become huge breasted and assed and eventually start to smell as bad as their partners.*
>
>*The horses in particular seem attracted to young adventurer girl asses that are bent over or squatting nice and low.*
>
>*Even a reluctant breeding cow becomes extremely wet and sweaty once mounted, ready for breeding. However Jonah and the girls barely know a thing about this.*
>
>*As they enter the small village, Jonah asks Mary "Hey mom. This place seems so ready and bustling for adventurer work huh? I wonder why the guilds avoid the place so."*

>*"What is this?" you exclaim, annoyed. "My intel can't have been bad, this was supposed to be a shrine of the herm worshipers!"*
>
>*A soft, sultry voice from the shadows makes a shiver of fear rush up your spine. The voice holds no hint of threat or malice, nor is it a strange one. On the contrary, your fear stems from recognizing this voice. It belongs to Rosa, a woman you had sacrificed for your campaign to even find the location of this church of hermaphrodites. The melodic cadence of her voice is the still the same as it had been the last time you'd seen her, but now her voice carries a sense of superiority and amusement that makes your hair stand on end.*
>
>*"Oh, but it is, Sir Loin. It very much is a 'church' as you call it. You see, us hermaphrodites have different definitions for places of worship." Rosa said. Her smile grew wide and devious as she saw the surprise in your face.*
>
>*With Rosa's arrival the room filled with the smell of sex and desire. At least that was what you felt as the pungent aroma took hold of your senses.*
>
>*"We consider ourselves our own gods, Sir Loin. We worship the Goddess, not a singular deity. To the Goddess we give what the other churches demand to be kept in that 'holy' matrimony of theirs. Instead of forcing ourselves to singular celibacy we give what's ours in tribute to the Church of the Holy Order of the Goddess: our seed. And men are the vessels we fill with it." Rosa explained. She stepped out of the shadows and approached you, wearing nothing but a silken robe and a thong which clung tightly to her curves. The sheer material of the underwear left little doubt that it hid a thick penis, one that she must have gained when she joined the cult.*

You've done your fair share of sacrificing party members for the sake of your goals and ideals. Now one of them, long thought 'sacrificed' in a battle against some cult has returned to put you in your place.

>
>*I smile at the girls. I'm happy to play along however they wish. In truth, I was hoping this weekend would be a more traditional girl's slumber party. That way I could admire my daughter and her cute young friends in their pajamas and not have to be afraid that my wife would catch me perving on them. Still, these outfits are cute in their own way, and being the 'Demon King' means I can wrestle with them and cop-a-feel.*
>
>*"You guys don't get it. Daddy, this is supposed to be the epic final battle. The Demon King needs to be scary and strong. So you need to be more aggressive, okay?" Katie tells me with an overly serious face.*
>
>*"More aggressive... Okay then," I say thinking deviously to myself.*

Your daughter and her friends are having a sleepover and playing pretend. You get to play the part of the Demon King. Your daughter takes playing pretend very seriously and wants you to get into your role.

>*She looked out at the waters, and that was when she saw him: a dark shadow, a ghostly apparition. He was cloaked in black, as though he came from the night itself. His hair, damp with seafoam, was as light as the moon, and his skin was a pale alabaster. He was tall and slender, moving with effortless grace. Arissia stared at him in both wonder and fear. The man stepped onto the shore, making nary a sound as his feet sunk into the sand. His lips quirked in what was almost a smile, though there was an odd emptiness in his eyes.*
>
>*He bowed and introduced himself. When he spoke, his voice was as gentle as a summer breeze, though its tone was laced with a sense of foreboding. "It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rien. What brings you here, to this shore?"*
>
>*"I am Arissia of Acadae," Arissia began. "My kingdom..." she broke off. Her throat felt thick with impending tears.*
>
>*Rien roved his eyes over the dead wilderness. In the distance the flames of the burning city cast red shadows across the land. "I see. Do you have somewhere to go?"*
>
>*"No...my father told me to escape, but..."*
>
>*"It will be dangerous," said Rien quietly, his eyes still gazing out at the burning city. "There is no place for a fallen kingdom's princess. I will accompany you."*
>
>*Rien offered his hand, and Arissia hesitantly took it. His skin was cool, his palm smooth, as though it were made of glass. Not knowing what else to do, she followed him on a journey without a destination.*

After the fall of her kingdom, Princess Arissia was alone. By the seaside, she met a ghostly man named Rien, who offered to accompany her on a journey through her dead kingdom. After their somber adventure, they found themselves at the seaside once more. It is winter, and Rien has a sinister proposal.

>*The inn was cozy, with wooden walls and a small hearth with a cauldron ofâGrifaldus sniffed appreciativelyâboar stew. Though the inn was empty of patrons, the party was too tired to notice. Grifaldus led the party to the bar, though they stopped short once they saw the bartender.*
>
>*The bartender was wearing the most peculiar mask, carved in polished wood with intricate lines and designs. It was a mask of a fox, and the bartender's eyes were hidden behind dark lenses.*
>
>*"Ah, new customers!" he trilled in a melodious voice. "A hale and hearty welcome to Dunwallon!" He bowed theatrically. "What brings you here?"*
>
>*"Well, good sir," said Grifaldus, his enthusiasm tempered by the oddity of the mask, "we were lost in the woods, and followed the light here. You see, we have been wandering for days, and we need a place to rest our heads."*
>
>*"Oh, how tragic," said the bartender. "I'm terribly sorry for your plight. Please, take a seat! We'll get you lot some hot food and warm drinks." He clapped his hands and serving maids appeared from shadowed doorways, their faces hidden behind impassive masks carved in the shape of animals. They carried silver trays laden with steaming bowls of soup and meat pies. The party, baffled, sat at one of the tables.*
>
>*"It's been so long since we last had visitors in Dunwallen," said one of the maids, her voice soft under her bunny mask. "So nice to see new faces." She giggled after uttering this last sentence, the dark eyes of her bunny mask peering with interest at Grifaldus. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that these odd masked servers were gathering around the rest of his party, whispering soft words and in general appearing a good deal more seductive than warranted, considering that the party was still dressed in their traveling clothes and haven't bathed in days.*
>
>*"Oh, uh, ahem," said Grifaldus articulately. "Yes, I suppose so. Er, if you don't mind me asking, why are you all wearing these peculiar animal masks?"*

After several long days of tramping through the woods, Grifaldus and his party of intrepid adventurers needed rest. Salvation arrived in the form of Dunwallen: an odd town where everyone wore animal masks. Well, nothing wrong with that...or was there?

>*"Wow, that really is a pretty sight," the lead clone said in awed reverence of the breathtaking sunset. Dave Z5-5J23 began snapping shots as his assistant recorded it on video. His diminished team of Daves eagerly gazed ahead, precariously perched atop a treacherously high mountain peak. One of the clones was so enamored viewing the alien forest vista, the Dave didn't notice his footing slipping. Several Daves whistled in appreciation at the plummeting spectacle, as others edged back a few inches. "Alright team, enough lollygagging, let's move into the forest proper."*
>
>*As the team slipped past alien trees, covered in purple, resinous extensions, one of the clone explorers cried out "Hey! Check it out! I found a neat leaf!" All the Dave clones eagerly gathered around, each equally appreciative of the seemingly conventional specimen of ground litter. "That little sucker is absolutely going in the scrapbook," the leader said authoritatively, as his identical companions excitedly nodded in agreement. They were all so distracted with the thrilling discovery, none of the clones noticed the crouched creature stalking up from behind.*
>
>*Chaos ensued, as a multi-limbed, tiger-like monstrosity set upon the Dave clones with predatory intent. The mandibles lining its slavering mouth latched upon the team leader as it gruesomely began chewing him apart, while clawing wildly at the others with its many talon-bearing legs. The Dave clones bravely set upon the creature with single-minded ferocity, attacking the alien beast in waves as they were systematically mangled to shreds. The surviving assistant fished their only radio from the deceased leader's half-eaten corpse, as he called in "Hey Dave, this is Dave 92-K880. There's this really cool leaf, but some ornery bugger is fucking with us. We're going to need more Daves, pronto."*

>*"Y-Your shield is quite impressive, sir; is it as heavy as it looks?" A good question, as the massive slab of steel to my left was more a wall than it was a mere shield; a rectangular bulwark of heavy metal with a thick rim of polished mithril.*
>
>*"Thanks," I said, flashing a smile. "It is quite heavy, indeed, but it is tried and true. Let's cut to it, if you don't mind my boldness; what happened to your previous 'tank'?" In such situations it was pertinent to prod. Seldom were parties broken without tragedy and I wanted to know who I'd be fighting alongside. Peck paused, his pale cheeks burning with shame, but another spoke for him.*
>
>*"She hit it big and ditched us, but that's not important," a bratty purr whispered from my periphery, its owner strutting into view. A young cat-girl, fancifully robed in the colors of a brilliant flame, stepped into view. Her ebon locks were a stark contrast to the emerald green eyes that she so analytically scanned me with. Lycille was her name as I'd come to find and she was Peck's partner in adventure.*
>
>*"Peck and I just need a piece of muscle to take the hits while we're doing the fun stuff," Lycille sat herself at the table, giving me the skeptical 'up and down', "but you don't look like much." Lycille spoke a big game but was she a big girl? No. She was nearly a child. Both she and Peck were; I found the pouty cat-girl's mannerisms endearing.*

When a humble kitsune boy named Peck and his fiery companion Lycille seek out a tank to join their party, who are you to turn down an opportunity for a new beginning?

>
>*Brunhilde looked about as embarrassed as you felt. Her chest rose and fell with heavy but controlled breaths. Meredith on the other hand seemed more amused and intrigued than anything. She rubbed her chin as she thought out loud "You know, we've so far seen a lot of subtle hints that the owner of this place is a sexual deviant. Remember the dream journal we found, Brunni?"*
>
>*Brunhilde laughed awkwardly at that, but nodded in agreement "Ah, ya. The one about the succubus assisted dreams, right? It was very...descriptive." Meredith grunted, pointing to the lock "I think he also mentioned the idea of using his 'prowess' as a way to lock his most precious belongings. If I'm right - and the way this lock is looking at you right now is telling me I'm right, Roger - you have to...well, unlock her through pleasure."*
>
>*"Uh...okay? I know you two keep calling me 'Lock Lover' and other things about me being intimate with locks when you think I'm sleeping, but this is a bit much for a joke, don't you think?" you replied with a wry chuckle as you squeezed the Lock-Lady's hips.*
>
>*Brunhilde averted her eyes as Meredith snickered, cooing "Oh I'm dead serious you sneaky bastard. You'll have to actually get hands-on with this lock and at least make her lose the willpower to keep the vault locked."*
>
>*That notion made you swallow. You stared at Meredith's delight, then to Brunhilde's disgusted-yet-aroused facial expression all the way back to the Lock-Lady at your mercy.*

Rogue School did not prepare you for this.

In this world, you're a greasy, grossly obese man with a terrible personality who gets beaten up for no reason all the time. But, say, in a world only filled with children...*
>
>*Heh, that might work out well! The thought is so exciting... if it works. You try to kill your creepy smile as you add the last finishing touches to the giant pentagram drawn on the ground before you. The candles are lit, the incense burned, and everything is ready.*
>
>*You take a deep breath, then begin to chant. "Slash Aids Slash! Theme Friday! I reject my destiny! Send me to Lolliland!"*

Her body looks quite young, but her thighs are those of a woman, and her breasts are full and perky. She wears a red vampire cape.*

>
>*Tanegawa-sensei is caught up by a giggle fit. Really, what's wrong with this girl? She's always so bubbly and excited, it's hard to believe that she's a teacher. Before I can get a word in of my own, she continues.*

She's cute as hell with her long blonde hair and bright blue eyes; what's worse is she knows it. "So Mister, now that we're all alone, I have a proposition for you. If you buy all twenty of the boxes we have left I'll give you a kiss..." she whispers, giving you a playful wink.*
>
>*It's almost impossible to resist this kind of behavior when combined with her youthful appearance and pretty features. You decide to make an effort anyway, "I-I don't know why you think that would be something I want, you're what, Ten? I'm a grown man, I don't want toâ"*

>*Sophie puts a finger to your lips, cutting off your rambling. "I'm eleven actually and you can stop lying... I saw you looking at my butt when we first knocked on your door. Whatta you say Mister? Wanna taste?"*

I have page after page of transcripts here, showing what kind of relationship you had with a supposed 17 year old. Need I remind you, of the age of consent laws in this state? I'll have you know, you were actually sexting with me, Chris Hansen this entire time."*

>*"Trespasser," the voice was angelic, yet marred by an unmistakable melancholy, "why have you slain my protectors? Defiled this most holiest of places with your unwelcome presence?" Lunanelle, Chief Goddess of the Moon, was all but a child in her appearance.*
>
>*"I beg your forgiveness," I bowed slightly. "It was not my intention to trespass, for I am merely here to seek an audience."*
>
>*You are a mortal," It was a curt response, void of affect or emotion, "but a curious one at that."*

A stranger in the presence of a Goddess, drawn to her by inexplicable forces. Was this a delicate rose to be protected? Or greedily plucked. A very open ended prompt about meeting a loli Moon Goddess.

### *Elves, Alchemy and Ejaculate*

>*"Ooh! A human, a human!" The all too eager voice of a child chirped, followed by a frolicking young elf. She'd all the makings of a young druidess, her tiny figure bound in a loose ensemble of luscious leaves and spindly vines. Her skin was the color of milk chocolate, her hair the shade of chestnut honey.*
>
>*She smiled at me, a wide, innocent smile that reminded me of a doe. "You're here for the Luminescent Nightshade, aren't you?" The question was rhetorical, accentuated with a knowing giggle. My captor turned her head to the forest as I futilely struggled in my dirt tomb. "Look what I found, Mama! Just what we were looking for!"*
>
>*Mama? Yes, Mama. As if materializing from the impermeable darkness of the shadows, an all too voluptuous elf made her presence known. "What a good catch, darling." This one was much more mature, in both gait and appearance. The resemblance between mother and daughter was uncanny: rich, chocolate complexions and golden eyes that hinted a predatory nature.*
>
>*"Just as I told you, The Forest always provides," she cooed, running her hands over the girl's face.*

A sultry tale on sultry night. Get kidnapped by a mother/daughter duo of Elf druidesses as they extract your magic man gravy.

### *Dragon Bussy. Drussy?*

>*"Your kind are so quick to violence! So quick to subjugation! Why would I disclose our holiest of places to you? A dragon-killer of all things?!"*
>
*We'd see about that. I took Dranpei by the throat, turning his cheeks the color of a ripened plum. The pride of dragons never ceased to amuse me. Dranpei could've been mistaken for budding maiden in his current, lissome form. An oversall lack of muscle tone and drastically softened features made him seem impossibly less malevolent.*
>
>*The dungeon cell was quiet, save the faint gasp that Dranpei released.*
>
>*"What's this?" I remarked coyly, noting the pulsing bulge that stressed the limits of his raggedy trousers. "You're...hard."*

With Dranpei - a feisty red dragon who prefers a humanoid form - cornered, how better to extract information than putting an extra bit of warmth in this fire-spitter's belly?


### *Nights Upon the Dunes*

>*The faint \*clinks\* of golden coins and medallions rattling against each other caught my attention, then the satin draped form of scantly-clad flesh. It was a dancer, with all the lithe grace and beauty of their kind. He was dark, like most desert folk were, though the boy bore a sparkling tan that spoke to his frequent exposure to sunlight. It was not odd for young boys, unfit for service or trade...or perhaps already trained to the subtleties of subservience, to take on the guise of a exotic dancer in order to survive. They were both entertainer and courtesan, pleasure-slave and consort.*
>
>*I was told to enter, by the company's commander, sir." He stated nervously enough. The consort's complexion was a rich amber, soft eyes as dark as sweetest dates, or the starless sky above the dunes. "He said you might require my assistance?"*

A battered veteran's night is spiced up when a exotic dancer of the dunes offers their companionship. When facing the hardships of age, is it not unwise to find comfort in the company of a youth?

### *Loli-Land!*

>*The name of this place was obviously meant as a joke, 'Loli-Land', or so I'd initially thoughtâbut a blind man could've seen how lewd the entire affair was. Little girls, none older that 15, could be seen skipping about in ensembles that befitted streetwalkers; frilly schoolgirl getups to tight, buttock-pinching G-strings and glittery nipple covers. How was any of this legal?*
>
>*"I have a coupon," I awkwardly forwarded a slip of paper, sliding it across the booth, "It says its for the 'All-Day VIP' pass?"*
>
>*A giddy little tease, the booth girl scanned the coupon for its validity, and upon satisfaction shot another brace-faced grin. "Wow! You're super lucky! You get to have all sorts of fun today!" She was positively frothing on her garish garments, "I'm jealous."*

Stumble upon the sick and depraved Loli-Land! Anything goes, you beautiful sicko you.

>*The exhausted runner was about to turn around and flee, when she spied a brightly-colored figure flashing across the beam of her flashlight. Paralyzed with fear, she nervously called out "Hello? Kid? I'm here to help! A-are you drowning in here?"*
>
>*Cindy became even more fearful, as she heard in response "Fuck me, you're a total butter-face bimbo, aint'cha? Goddamn hooligans don't give a rats ass about quality vs quantity." The malevolent, mocking, and utterly inhuman voice terrified the unprepared woman beyond measure. It then continued "Anyway, you'll float, look into the Dead Lights, et cetera et cetera, good food good meat, good god let's eat!" were the last words Cindy heard, as a grease painted, red nosed face reared up from the sewer depths.*

Pennywhistle the monster clown is on hard times, and is resorting to desperate measures to get his fix of fearful prey. The voracious, hulking harlequin plans to regain his strength, and the respect of the community that once feared him, by devouring an endless parade of seedy hos.

>*The sudden vulnerability he's showing has me floored, and I'm trying to think of something to help him out. Eventually, my mind lands on the idea of giving him something to look forward to. Something he can strive towards, a positive to outweigh the negative. "Alright, Zack, how about this? You like me, right? And I like you. So, if we go to this amateur night, and you go and do a bit without panicking, then I'll let you fuck me," I offer.*
>
>*Oh, that got his attention alright, and his face goes bright red. "F-Fuck...? Like... me, and you, in bed, doing... that? You... you serious?" he stammers out.*
>
>*"Yeah, I'm serious. I figure that if your problem is that you keep visualizing the worst way things could go, maybe you need something positive to look forward to? And what better to do that with than both of us losing our virginities to each other? Sounds like a great time to me!" I tell him, placing my hand on his shoulder reassuringly.*
>
>*His response takes a while to come out, but when it does, he simply nods his head and says, "I'll give it a try." With that, he heads over to the bedroom and begins thinking about his material. Looking through the door, I can see the intensity in his expression as he sits there at the desk, musing over a sheet of paper and scribbling his plan out. I think I've given him a good thing to shoot for.*

My boyfriend always considered himself to be a funny guy, but when the prospect of performing an amateur comedy night at a local club rolls around, a big case of performance anxiety rears its ugly head. I want to convince him to give it a try, but he'll definitely need some support to get through it. Maybe a dirty little promise will help...

>*Glenda dropped the snake on its head, hard, as it instantly began squirming around angrily. The roused reptile promptly began coiling its rippling, squeezing length around the struggling stripper, immediately pinning her in place. It all happened so fast, Glenda barely had time to squeak in alarm, before the snake was squeezing her so hard, she couldn't breathe or cry out.*
>
>*Several of the assembled young boys gasped and yelled in distress, Malcolm crying softly, as Paxton just raised an eyebrow in interest, fascinated that something cool was finally happening at his birthday. He quickly shushed the other lads, who seemed scared, but followed his cues. Just then, Judy popped her head into the playroom, suspiciously asking "What's going on? We heard a racket is uh... 'boy time' nearly over?"*
>
>*Malcolm inhaled to respond, before Paxton pulled him aside and yelled out "Nothing's wrong mom! Screw off, we need more time!"*

As a spoiled, pampered child reaches his vaunted thirteenth birthday, he's eager to show off his family's wealth to his lackeys and friends. Planning to hire a real, live stripper, dressed as his favorite video-game character, Ankha, Paxton Martinelli hope's to host a party nobody will ever forget. But, will improper prop handling propel the pole-dancer into peril?

>
>*"Welcome, mister!" one of the lolis trots up to you - a delicate little girl with long light brown hair tied into two fluffy ponytails, "I haven't seen you here before. New customer?" she smiles at you.*
>
>*"Yea." you respond reluctantly.*
>
>*"Don't be shy! I'm Cara, would you like to have me? I can show you around!" the little girl grabs your hand and holds it in her small palms - her tiny fingers look so gentle and fragile.*

>
>*"I don't need your stupid money!" She shouts before lowering her volume again, "I have a way to make my own money without Mom or you. I just know you're a nerd and I need your help with a dumb app on my phone."*
>
>*"An app?" I ask.*
>
>*"Yeah, a friend from school was telling me about it. She said her big sister posts pictures on the app to make money. I wanted to do it too, but when I was signing up for it I put in my birthday and the app says I'm blocked now."*
>
>*My mind races as I realize what type of app she is talking about. I yank my sister into my room and close the door.*

Your little sister Molly is a brat. She wanted desperately to be more like a teenager so she started demanding expensive makeup, trendy clothing, and even a cellphone. When your Mom has had enough she cut her off. Instead of trying the things normal 11yo would do to make money like opening a lemonade stand or mowing lawns, she tried to sell pictures of herself online. When the app banned her for age as she was signing up she comes to you for help.

They were both too busy being invested in their own careers and hobbies to worry about her. Hailey is used to being alone, but it still makes her sad.*
>
>*So when a big, brown and white dog runs up to her while she's wading in the ocean, she is beside herself. She knows her mom doesn't like animals and is scared of dogs. Kim wouldn't want her daughter petting one. But with a quick check to look at her mom, who seems like she's sleeping on her towel, Hailey reaches out slowly to pet the dog's head. "Here, boy."*

>*She opens the door to greet the visitor. You look over to see who it is, and that's when you first see her...*
>
>*An alien girl. She looks a bit older and more developed than your Suzie, but still a teenager. She has turquoise skin, long teal hair, funny antennae, and she's wearing a shirt that looks just like Suzie's, but hers reads... "I COME IN PEACE"!*

>*"Detective Anon!" Deborah chirps up from her desk in the lobby. A young and lithe specimen, just barely turned thirty-one. People around the office all wonder why you haven't asked her out yetâit's obvious she likes you, and any other guy would certainly jump at the chance if she had taken a liking to them. "I'm so glad I caught you! There's a young girl waiting to talk to you in one of the waiting rooms, she wouldn't talk to anyone else."*
>
>*"Oh really?" You furrow your browâthis couldn't be anything good.*
>
>*"Her name's Layla. Twenty one years old, here all alone. Says her parents were too busy to be here with her. Poor thing looked like she was about to cry..."*
>
>*You sigh deeply, taking off your coat and setting it on the coat rack before walking through the glass doors into the main area. "Thanks Deb, I'll go talk with her."*

You are a detective in an alternate reality of extended childhood and adolescence, where people are not considered legal adults until the age of thirty. It is your job to catch "young adult molesters"âYAMOs for short. You're good at your job, but today you will find yourself tempted by a young twenty one year-old girl who seeks your protection...

>*"P-please, what is the meaning of this? This is most improper!" Madeline squeaked out, as Xithrax finished using her reptilian tongue to undress the tutor. The voracious dragoness extended her scaly claw, forcing the petite instructor down onto the manicured, grass-covered ground. Madeline hysterically begged for answers "W-what is the meaning of this? What is your dragon going to do? You're a noblewoman yourself, you have more than enough power to stop this! Why are you allowing such a disgraceful act?!"*
>
>*Xithrax's bifurcated tongue flicked out again, as the dragoness spoke "Queen Vandavia, shall I partake? I am ever so hungry to chase that delicious tea with a fine snack."*
>
>*Vandavia nodded. "Yes please, I think Miss Halbrook here, would make for a fitting contribution to my royal guardian's heft."*

Madeline Halbrook is an esteemed instructor in the feminine arts of etiquette, poise, hospitality, and diplomacy. But, when the beautiful tutor is charged with turning the future heir of the Rastmarl throne into a proper lady, Madeline may find difficulty in reaching her young, haughty, royal student. Tea time takes on a turbulent new tone, as Madeline is forced to accommodate a particularly unladylike guest of the Rastmarl princess.

>*"Who's there? Come around to the other side so I can see you," she yelped, kicking her legs a bit more now to indicate distress, her backside facing you. "I've been stuck in here for a while!" The sorceress' face was flushed, and her long, black hair extending down like her arms. Her eyes were wide open and darting around, taking in every detail of the room that she could see. Watching her rump waggle made me pause for a moment as she tried to move her body in vain. As she kicked, glimpses of her underwear flashed when her robe shifted around a little too much. Trying to clear my mind of what I was seeing, I quickly paced over to the other side of the wooden device to face the girl, instead of her posterior.*
>
>*"My name is Alexander," I introduced myself, looking at the sorceress, who stared back at me with wide, teary eyes. "What's your name?"*
>
>*She quickly blurted out, "Solaria, fire sorcerer." She added a prideful tone as she announced her title, but it was deflated by the fact that she was trapped inside a pillory. "Now c'mon, free me already! T-This sucks, you know?"*

Your tense crawl through a dungeon filled with monsters is halted by the last thing you were expecting to find, a sorcerer dangling uselessly in a wooden device. Okay, it's a pillory. I just wanted to be nice. There's quite the dilemma to have here. Will you free her and work with her to escape the dungeon safely? Or will you take advantage of her misfortune?

>*"Mommyâ¦"*

>
>*"Cummy," said Violet, in her sharp, decisive voice. Here? Now? Joy had tried to 'take care' of her daughter before they left, making sure she let out at least three distinct loads, gallons upon gallons of the white slurry pumped into the special drain she had installed in their home. She had naively hoped that might have been enough to temporarily sate little Vi's libido for at least long enough to reach her doctor's office for this appointment. Even still, she should have known better than to take her out without a double layer of the oversized condoms she used for protection in public. But they were expensive and Violet had gone through the box after her last outing. Joy had planned to buy more on their way back from the doctor's office.*
>
>*But here she was, with her daughter's immense cock, sticking straight up, clearly visible in the mirror. The thought of what anyone who glanced at their car might see was mortifying.*

Little girl, big dick, bigger cooms. Mom is trying her best.

>
>*But a sudden rustle in the darkness forced Chrissy into action. The spry woman leveled a can of bearspray in the direction of the voice, and blasted out a cloud of noxious capsaicin. An overwhelming smell of rotting meat filled the air, as a powerful, furred paw swatted the athletic woman to the ground with ease. A coughing, feminine voice spoke out above Chrissy "Ah, my meal spices itself, how exquisite."*
>
>*Chrissy awkwardly groped for her lantern flashlight, turning it on as it illuminated a ghastly abomination, hulking above her.*

A group of anthropomorphic Forest Scouts are learning about roughing it in the forest the hard way. Chrissy and Megan, their inadequately trained scoutmasters, may not be able to control the situation, as scary storytelling gets out of hand.

>
>*"I know what kind of thoughts you're having mister," she says softly. "But I promise I won't tell anybody. You don't have to worry about anything happening to your secret, okay? We can both benefit from this, so just trust me a lil' bit, I'm not gonna to say a word to anyone else."*
>
>*I try to respond, but can't find the words, so instead I simply nod dumbly. She grabs my wrist, pulling me down the sidewalk. "W-Where are we going?" I stammer, following after her as best I can.*
>
>*"Somewhere private," she replies coyly, leading me down the road.*

After [meeting a horny brat at the grocery store](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/354149827/#354393382), things quickly spiral out of control when she proposes a unique arrangement.

>
>*"Where am I?" Mei asks with fear in her voice. "Did you kidnap me?!"*
>
>*"W-Woah wait don't get too worked up or you'llâ" I was interrupted by a giant poof of pink smoke that slowly dissipated, revealing Mei, now transformed into a giant ten foot tall red panda. It took me a while (and a lot of broken furniture), but I finally managed to get Mei to calm down and get her to change back into a human so I could explain things to her.*
>
>*"So I came out your computer?" Mei asked.*
>
>*"Long story short, yes." I replied. "And no, I didn't kidnap you. at least I didn't do it on purpose."*
>
>*Mei nodded in acknowledgement before turning to face away from me, resting against the headboard of the bed. Mei sighed heavily as she stared at the ceiling, taking all of the information in. After a few minutes had passed, she looked back at me.*

>*"So... what now?" Mei asked me.*

Have you ever wanted to spend time with Mei from Turning Red? well I sure have! So if there's anyone like me out there then I hope you have a swell time with Mei.

>*The redheaded starlet's panic rose to new levels, as she realized the huge, aggressive canine was now actively humping at her rear, her dress rucked up over her hips, as she felt Sam's long canine claws scratching at her back. The husky's paws dug into the flesh of Christina's creamy back, as she felt the wet prick of his swelling dog penis poking inquisitively against her pubic mound. Christina was mortified, her legs beginning to shake, and her breathing growing heavy as the enormous canine pressed closer. Christina found herself firmly pressed down on her stomach and huge breasts, as Sam shifted his weight further onto her back. She could feel the hard tip of the husky's thick penis prodding at her nether regions, as Christina moaned out for help.*
>
>*Christina Hendricks tried to shift out from under the amorous canine, but was helplessly kept in place by the huge dog's front paws, and the force of his weight pressing against her raised-up bottom. Lisette watched, amused, as Christina writhed underneath the husky, trying to push herself out from beneath the canine, but failing miserably. "It's okay Joana, just relax. Sam has been preparing himself for this moment for a long time. My Vengeance will be complete." As Lisette spoke, the husky's knotty cock throbbed heavily, and Sam's body suddenly tensed, as he drove home his thick, muscular length.*

When an ailing young girl named Lisette lies stricken with cancer, her desperate parents are left grieving and unprepared. The bereaved parents are eager to grant whatever happiness they can into their debilitated youth's life, and by reaching out to charities, miracles can happen. When the Make-A-Wish foundation takes notice of Lisette's desperate state, the young woman's fondest dreams may finally be made reality. Will Christina Hendricks, famed redheaded television starlet, be able to bring a smile to a sickly child's face?

>*The novelty of the inexplicable event immediately ceased, as the predatory creature opened its toothy, red-gummed maw wide. Instinct and two weeks of military training kicked in, as Yevgeny popped the creature in its stubby muzzle, right on the snout. He tried to shout "Cyka bylat!" But only emitted a burst of bubbles, as the huge, muscular shark woman recoiled in shock from the blow.*
>
>*The shark woman's black eyes narrowed in anger, as she used her clawed hands to assertively pin his arms down to his sides. The undersea predator opened her maw wide again, preparing for a massive chomp, as Yevgeny just angrily stared back. He flinched as she lunged, but she pulled back at the last moment, an unreadable expression flashing across her, seemingly emotionless, shark face. The creature hesitantly gnashed at him several more times, but seemed somehow reluctant to commit. Yevgeny was quite terrified, and rapidly drowning, but he thought he must of been hallucinating when the shark woman effortlessly spoke to him underwater, her gravelly, husky voice saying "That was a pretty good jab... for a scrawny Nerd."*

When the Russian special force unit, VDV, incurs massive losses invading Ukraine, Putin issues emergency drafts to refill the paratrooper rosters. When the young Yevgeny is drafted to lead a suicidal child soldier battalion during the naval invasion of Odessa, fate intervenes dramatically. Will the stalwart, sensitive young man be able to lose his virginity, before he loses his life to the cruel Black Seas?

Worse, she was completely naked, exposed to the stinking, putrid elements, as she gazed around at her surroundings. The woman had been dumped right into the middle of a swampy bog, her feet standing on a massive lily-pad. As soon as Helen discerned the nature of her surrounding biome, the terrified woman's nerves somehow ratcheted up to another level of alarm. The roaring croak that issued out from behind her, however, made Helen collapse into a shrieking mass of horror. It's bulging, green heft shook the lilypad as it clambered on, as a bulbous toad began confidently approaching the hysteric Helen.*

The mind is a terrible thing to taste.

>*The day was the 25th of February, 2022. Each anon in the thread eagerly waited to find out which theme had won the biweekly vote. However, things were not to be so easy. The Pollster, rentfree himself arrived in the thread with strange tiding. It appeared that an "anomaly" had occurred in the voting! From what The Pollster was willing to divulge, it seemed as if a theme idea had won by a large margin of victory, something that simply did not match the population of Threadsville.*

>
>*Now that the Grunch's grim hunch, that it's personal grudge against the whole bunch, could be clutched with no fuss, it cackled and huffed. The Grunch's eternal war against youth and innocence, playful, carefree, young-bodied sinfulness, had caused the crumple of Cunnymas due to its influence, it gloated. How could the cheer of youth endure, under the perjure of war, the crucible were all childishness perished?*

Don't let the Grunch crunch your Munch.

>*"Ms. Miller? Are you alright in there? we heard a commotion--" but Amara's worried voice was cut off by a much more desperate, muffled shriek, as Amara reasoned something terrible was happening to the woman inside.*
>
>*Amara panicked for a moment, before working her kitchen knife along the edge of the door where the lock connected, to see if she could manually work the bolt back. Further sounds of struggle and distress made her flinch, but Amara found success and managed to wiggle the door's latching bolt loose, Amara clutching the knife tight as she prepared to swing it open. Several other scared women crowded around behind, backing her up. The female group gasped in unison, the women struggling to make out the strange, obscene spectacle before them. Tanya Miller was sprawled out naked on the floor, wiggling helplessly, seemingly constrained and struggling against... something. It took a moment for Amara to understand what she was seeing, as she realized there was a large, translucent lizard creature rapidly making progress devouring the helpless cat woman, whole and alive.*

A young fox woman's life is torn apart by the consequences of a grueling generational war. Strange creatures and devastated ruins are all that remains of her people's hated enemies, the Elvanians, but even supposed victory carries terrible consequences.

>*"Yeah, it's probably a trap," said a large, busty alligator named Kelly. She stretched her muscular limbs, causing her breasts to wobble and sway underneath her skimpy bikini top, before tilting her head and eyeing Daphne critically. "Why, you scared?"*
>
>*Before the gecko could respond, a wide, yellow-furred bear exited from the back door with a predatory smile on her face. "Well, aren't ya'll a cute bunch? And what a lovely day out, too."*
>
>*The reptiles stared at her with suspicion as the bear kept her paws behind her back and her chest jutted out aggressively. The large, flat muscles bulged underneath her thin, flannel shirt as she sniffed and smacked her lips.*
>
>*"Hey Francine. Decide to hold a barbecue for your reptilian betters or something?" Kelly flashed a smirk from her toothy maw.*
>
>*Francine scowled deeply, her ursine visage twisting in disdain. "Enough of your cold-blooded bullcrap. Ya think you can just whine about 'insulation' or whatever, while you strut around in your little outfits?" Her tone grew increasingly condescending as she added, "Ya got no idea how hot fur keeps you. I think ya'll need to be taught some humility." She took her paws from behind her back and brandished a large water gun. "Get 'em, girls!" She sprayed ice-cold water everywhere in one spritz as the reptiles shrieked.*

>
>*<It's either that or die, Karl. My body has not been fed properly since the war began. I can't sustain myself without food. My wound's aren't healing quickly enough, I need fresh meat.>*
>
>*Karl grimaced at her soundless words in his head, as he mentally responded <I hate when you refer to them as 'fresh meat', these are subjects of the Kingdom, and they are providing a noble service to the realm, just as their menfolk are on the frontline.>*
>
>*Luna answered with a soft mental sigh. <They may be subjects of our kingdom, I cannot deny my needs, especially since we are the last few surviving dragon cavalry. We must honor these elven women's sacrifices, but all the same I need to fill my belly, my wounds don't heal on their own.>*
>
>*Karl sighed deeply before responding, <Fine then, but make these women count, I'm sure they'd much rather be servicing the kingdom in other ways.>*

The Calrodian kingdom was forged in war, and caught in the grips of a desperate invasion, it may soon fall to the same force. Even the kingdom's famed and feared dragon riders were unable to stop the gunpowder weapons of the invading Amurian tribes, as the numbers of King Calrod the Fourth's elite reptilian fighting force were devastated by repeated defeats. A lone rider named Karl, and his dragon, Lunarathrax, fight a desperate battle to harry the invading forces, as the burdens of surviving the difficult campaign become both logistical and moral.

>*"Ah, you must be Aelius Marius. The Emperor has told me you would be coming, and he told me that you are a great, honorable man that has served him so well. Please, relax with me," she says before motioning me to the nearby couch, an invitation I gladly accept. We are brought a bit of food to snack on, and some idle conversation begins.*
>
>*To begin with, I figure I should at least learn her name. "It is an honor to meet you, though I must admit that I have not yet had the pleasure of knowing your name, and it would be quite a shame to not know the name of such a beautiful lady," I tell her with a soft smile.*
>
>*The answer that comes back shocks me. "Oh, of course. I am Julius Avilius," she replies. But, wait... that name is masculine. A sudden confusion strikes me, emotions running wild inside me.*
>
>*In the end, I have to know. I have to confirm this. "Pardon me for asking, but... did you just say your name was... Julius?" I ask, feeling my voice getting shakier.*

In Rome, there lives a slave of the Emperor famed for sexual prowess and beauty, though hardly anyone knows the slave is actually a man. After a successful campaign in Germania, one virtuous commander is rewarded with a night together with that very slave.

>*The American invasion camp had settled into a defensible copse of dense woods and shrubs on a hill in Basse-Normandie. Staring out of the bocage foliage, the young U.S. sentry squinted as he saw a pack of animals sprinting over a nearby hill. The volunteer didn't know what the M.O. was on local wildlife, as he wondered what to do. He got nervous as they continued bounding forward. They looked like big wolves, and were bearing down fast, so he shot a warning shot, hoping nobody would be pissed if he raised a ruckus. The shaggy beasts continued approaching, as the sentry fired his Garand true, but barely caused the beast to flinch, though he was sure he'd plugged it. Several other nearby soldiers began firing alongside, roused to action as the huge, hulking wolves finished closing the distance.*

As the Allies invade Normandy, the Nazi war effort becomes increasingly desperate. Hitler's visions of an army of 'werewolf' partizans inspires unethical Nazi occult researchers to invent a war-winning weapon. However, prime test subjects are required. For a potent, universally applicable combat-serum, steadfast pacifists seem to make for prime test subjects. As pious, young, Jehovah's Witnesses are herded into the French countryside, cruel science asks the question: Can one man's will to remain moral, overcome this ghastly world's imposed, bestial urges?

One or uh... several of our neighbors are behind the unrest, and simultaneously invading. But, we've still got out an ace in the hole: the hostage wards from our earlier victories. They invade us? I'll show their pretty little princesses I mean business."*
>
>*Her grizzled accountant, a former mercenary paymaster up-jumped into royal station, wisely agreed "Yes, with our neighbor's noble-blooded maidens imprisoned, we can compel incredible ransom and deference, perhaps even prevent fullscale--" but Serephina halted him too. "Oh no, we're beyond that now, the war is ON. I'm going to do exactly what I said I'd do, and give those haughty bitches, who've been lazing around, eating my food, a thorough personal tour of my digestion system!" Her war council collectively cringed, as Serephina's hissing voice rose to hysteric highs. Many of them had been campaigning with the head-strong, ophidian harridan long enough to know when she was on an emotional tear.*

A string of successful wars has netted the scaly, ophidian, barbarous Serephina a newly-forged kingdom to lord over, with all the benefits that entails. But when domestic and international forces unite to overthrow her greedy, incompetent, hedonistic rule, Serephina resorts to the most drastic measures left to her: She lets her emotions take the throttle, and stuffs her tapering, serpentine body to bloating.

>*Suddenly, the sensation intensified, radiating out from the Underfolk's procession in radiating waves. Even their deprived sharks shuddered and struggled from the waves of electricity scorching all through the ocean zone, as Angela struggled even to stay conscious under the shocking assault. As the great sharks seized and contorted, their obscuring burden fell away, as an unfathomably horrifying sight greeted the paralyzed mermaids. A massive eel, of terrifyingly disproportionate physiology, was calmly swimming towards their position, its huge body effortlessly radiating an unbearable field of electric torment. As the huge, ominous eel approached, its massive jaws moved apart, unhinging bizarrely. Angela realized its maw was extending many yards in each direction, forming a huge, cavernous chamber. The gulper eel opened its huge maw wide, and sucked a whirlpool of water through its obscenely spacious mouth, powerful jets of expelled water exiting its flapping gills. Angela was still too paralyzed to resist, as her body was pulled by the artificial current towards the creature's waiting mouth. Her equally immobilized battle sisters were caught in the current too, joining her ignoble trajectory towards its gaping jaws.*

Life underwater in the ocean is tranquil and idyllic for the mermaids of the Sargasso Confederation. But, when an ancient foe rises up from the depths, is a lifetime spent in paradise enough to prepare these water bound, half fish women.

Ever since I first saw him, I have believed he was delivered in this world by the gods of love and allure themselves, for he displays such youthful, barely pubescent desire that no mortal could ever hope to match. My heart is about to burst from my yearning to touch him, to hold him, to make love to him as I watch him prance nude in the courtyard as he always does. Seeing him like this reminds me of my own youth, when I was still tutored by my elders in ways of war, philosophy and even love.*
>
>*As much as I would've desired, eventually I too must renew drawing breath. With a long exhalation the smoke exits my lungs, and with it my senses return to the hilltop, surrounded by my companions. As I let my breath even out, I turn to regard the messenger with my full attention. "Polemos has arrived?" I confirm. "Good, let us return to camp and not keep him waiting any longer, this siege needs to be broken as soon as possible."*

You may see the young men from the USO with those trays full of baseballs, were you'd normally see peanuts and hotdogs. Well, raise your hand, toss 'em the price of a meal, and take aim, because each of these young ladies will be singing above a dunk tank! Don't like their tone? Just toss the grating geisha a fastball, and old Inky here will handle the rest!" Chuck finished with heaping enthusiasm, again gesturing at the huge, ominously agitated octopus in the water tank. Already, the baseball vendors were being flagged down, struggling to meet demand before the first girl had even gone on stage. "Well, without further ado-doo, let's start the show! Amika, step on up, and start things off!" Howrie exclaimed, gesturing towards a Japanese woman at random, not knowing their names.*

Now, I'll be honest, it's going to be a slow, painful, humiliating process for you to endure. A girl your size usually isn't easy to swallow, not without a lot of struggle. But, I've had many large meals before. It shouldn't be too difficult to fit you down my throat, as long as you don't struggle too much. So, now, let's get started. Get those ridiculous clothes off."*

Then, suddenly, as the girl realized what he was asking, She began to panic, knowing that she didn't have a choice. How could she say no to this dangerous, powerful alien? "Sir... A-are you really asking me to crawl naked into your mouth?" she stuttered, her voice quavering. "You want to eat me alive?!"*

However, Reagan persevered in championing the measures, touting the tangible economic benefits of this "futa initiative" (which would become popularly known as 'futanomics'), and in the process managed to convince congress and even his own political opposition.*

Your village has been quite forthcoming in making sure the transition to integration goes smoothly, and as such, you are going to be privy to a very rare honor indeed! My name is Comrade Fedorov, and I am a member of the 3rd Support Battalion, the First Comrade's chosen ones. And I am here to tell you that you will be the founding members of the 1st Volunteer Support Battalion, a group that will eventually stand just as tall as the 3rd! Of course, we will have to build it up first, so you will at first be subordinated to the 3rd, but suffice it to say that you will soon be just as glorious!" he explains, conviction and intensity clear in his voice.*
>
>*There is a murmur between the ten of us. This does seem like a promising offerâafter all, Vesnistan is gone, and getting on the State's good side as a collaborator would be a smart move. Still, this is all a bit quick. However, Fedorov doesn't give us a lot of opportunity to think about our doubts. "Now, I will make it clear that you will be the first to have a new mandate placed upon you. All of you will from now on live your lives in accordance with the First Comrade's teachings! And in order to make that clear, you will now take part in the 3rd's initiation. As page 33 of the First Comrade's teachings says: 'The first part of being a good comrade is knowing of the greatest love.' And the greatest love... is that between men of the State!" he says, and at first, we don't really get it.*

When the war came to our village, all that it amounted to was a few tanks rolling in, one overeager guy getting shot, and the rest being informed as to how things would work from now on. But then, about two weeks later, a new group of soldiers rolled in, bringing with them some... strange new ideas.

>*"Patience, Maree. They may not be onto us yet, but I'm not losing any of you to overconfidence." Jainie gave a quick scritch under Maree's ear. "Remember what happened last time we got sloppy."*

The rebel leader then led them up to and around the nearest side of the large house. There was a candle burning inside, and they could hear faint moans from within. They kept quiet and circled around the corner of the building until they reached a window.
Jainie stopped and gestured at the window with her chin. "Maree, you're up."*

You know what Jamie means; the alcohol, the weapons. Things both of you pretend to not know about for your sake alone. But even so you have grown to hate the sound of the her small hand pounding impatiently at the door in the early hours. It's much too early in the morning for someone to be knocking and demanding entry into your unkempt apartment. Trying to keep the thoughts of misery from your troubled mind you shout out a hurried response, "I'm coming! Hold on!" You need to fake a cheerful, or at least demure attitude in order to avoid alerting Jamie to your grim thoughts and being hospitalized.*

In a very distant year in the future, those identified as having "dangerous thoughts" are required to have a state social worker visit them several times a week by government mandate.

>*Scientists had discovered an entire island that had appeared a few months ago containing several extremely advanced species, looking like the animals on your world, only given hundreds of thousands of years to mutate and grow into advanced, sentient beings that could think and talk. It only took a few months for them to learn the English language, and not long after that the internet suddenly clammed up, with nothing interesting happening.*
>
>*But all of that happened months ago. Suddenly the US government had revealed that they had imported a few species of monster girls, and with the help of scientists had hammered out a few rules. Among them came a few new mandates. Like the one that had you in this office just now: At least once a month all able-bodied males were to report to the nearest government-approved sperm bank or hospital to breed these girls and grow their population. It even came with a clause stating that should you choose, you can then adopt the monster girl you bred, with official documentation and a certificate and everything. Relationship status did not matter, all you could think about were those with wives who were probably rallying to the cause like they did that orange-haired mop-top all those years ago.*

>*In the not-so-distant future, those in power declared sexâand anything relating to the actâunnecessary and archaic. Established in its place was a new standard: a future of artificial birth, sterilization, and abstinence. State-mandated hormone inhibitors spread across the country faster than anyone expected. Quick rehabilitation, if not outright disposal, quelled what minor rebellion there was. And now, over thirty years after the initial inception of these new regulations, sexual desire was all but absent in the average household.*
>
>*But even though the wound had long-since healed, infection from within still lingered. It began in a small college of about three hundred students. An anonymous band of undergraduates referred to only as âThe Seduction Societyâ began to act once every two weeks. The purpose was simpleâpublic spectacle and disorder for the sake of sexual freedom. From posters of outlawed pornography hung around the campus, to disruption of inhibitor distribution, this underground society sought to shock, incite, and excite the student body with their acts of perversion. And though the limelight shone brightly on their clique, they always remained anonymous in all matters.*
>
>*That was until one evening when a freshmanâa young man obsessed by the society's presenceâtook it upon himself to confront the group. With enough evidence to take their entire crew down, he uncovered the their base of operations: the basement of an old abandoned house in town. They were there to discuss plans involving something only referred to as âOperation Pink Pillâ, a plan which would forever change the face of sexual revolution. The man who uncovered their deeds was none other than me, and once I had learned the location of their meeting, I wasted no time in confronting them.*

And for this reason, the Socialust Party will go to any lengths to protect itself and its puppet masters, the globalist cabal of hell." With a sudden zoom out, the camera shows Mark reach for his small wooden clubâGod, he really is going all out today. His face is visibly redder with anger. Mark grips the club tightly in his callous hand and hits the table with loud thuds punctuating every syllable for emphasis. "They are demons! Literal demons!"*

All this time, fools thought that the Socialust Party cared about our welfare, that they were fighting for our rights and freedoms. But the truth was far different than imagined. The reality is that they were trying to infiltrate our human society and destroy us from the inside.*

## The Friday of *Fucked Up Theme Parks*

Let's make prompts in honor of Roller Coaster Tycoon.

### *Clussy Park*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2939>*
{: .center}

>*"Uh, hi... I uh... have a VIP ticket..." Anon stammered nervously. Tootie's eyes widened, before honking loudly and giving him a big hug. He squeaked in surprise but soon regained his composure once he felt her firm tits pressed against his chest. He reached down to feel them but Tootie quickly grabbed his hand and led him to the side of the counter.*
>
>*She pulled out a small pad of paper and pen then wrote something down. When she finished writing she handed him the note which read: "You're lucky today since you've got your own personal Clown Girl tonight! She'll guide you through the park, and make sure you have lots of fun! Cuddling (and more) is avalible on request!"*

Which lovely lady will accompany Anon on his sexual romp through the park?

### *Sadie's Playland*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2954>*
{: .center}

>*"Excuse me, miss?" Anon said as he walked towards the dumpster fire in front of Mackland. The trio turned and stared at him, looking bored out of their minds. Slowly, their eyes focused on him, expressions switching between annoyance, confusion, and finally settling on a predatory lust. Anon's heart started to beat hard in his chest. Those women wanted something from him, and judging by the way they stood up straight once more after staring at him intently, he probably wouldn't survive if he resisted. "Umm... I just wanted to know if the park was open! I'll leave you alone! Sorr-"*
>
>*"No, no, sit down." The tallest one of the group gave a hand signal to the other two, both of them relaxing as they saw. She gave the practiced grin of a charlatan as she looked at Anon. "I'm guessing you're here for the same reason we are..."*

Anon's dream of going to Mackland theme park is finally realized, with the park's owner, Sadie, even offering to show him around herself. What's that? The park's been abandoned years ago, and Sadie is the leader of the homeless squatters living in the park? Don't be ridiculous.

### *Atomic World*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2952>*
{: .center}

>*After several hours travelling by bus, I finally find myself at the best theme park in the world: Atomic World! The lines are huge and everybody is excited to enter the park; I even see a few mutated people sporting extra limbs, two heads, disgusting lumpy flesh, and one man even had a pair of massive tits and a massive 10" dick while his wife has a pair of dog ears and three legs. I wonder if she has two pussies. The entrance is shaped like a mushroom cloud with giant words reading "Atomic World" along the mid-section. Posters showing rides and mascots are plastered over the walls, with park's slogan: "Atomic Fun For Everyone!"*

Atomic Work is a theme park with several themed areas with nuclear power/wasted mixed in.

### *Feel Warm Inside At Bussy Land*
{: .center}

{: .center}

>*I remember how excited a bunch of us were: A new theme park, opening in our shitty town? While the jobs wouldn't be glamorous, me and my peers were far past being picky. The town had gone to Hell in the last decades, with manufacturing jobs that used to support so many families here just vanishing, the promise of stable work just up and gone. Now that my generation was getting out of school and into the job market, we were desperate. So when that theme park offer rolled in, our town was all ears, and so were we, signing up by the dozens. It seemed kinda weird, named something like "Bus Land" or something, but again, we were desperate. None of us read the fine print. Maybe we should have.*

As a young man fresh out of school in a dying town, finding a job is incredibly difficult. So when a rich businessman shows up wanting to open a theme park with hundreds of jobs just outside of town, I end up not reading the fine print too much. I thought I was signing up for "Bus Land". I was not.

### *The Grunch Who Would Change Cunnymas*

{: .center}

>*The plan was performing perfectly, or so the Grunch thought. It had performed for the public, proselytizing perfidious perjuries, previewing polemics and perils for the panicky populous. It had even corrupted the vile Mormon and his insufferable project. No more could the vile pedos simulate sinful sensuous solicitations from schoolgirls with 175beaks of searing speed and specificity. But, the devious deviants had devised a direct dissenter to the Mormon's moral mollifications. Again, the Grunch's sensitive ears were tortured by the clicker-clack of a thousand keyboards tap, as sickos serviced oppai lolibabas without care or concern. This would not do.*

Stop the future for AI that none of us want.

### *GF Dreamland*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3001>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/2qvque.png)
{: .center}

>*I was ushered forward, shaken and stirred by her touch, and through the gates of the GF Dreamland. Women populated every cornerâmany of them weren't even staring at me, but I felt as if they wanted to devour me alive. They wore bright, tight clothing that left little to the imagination. It exposed their skinâsoft and suppleâbreasts big and bountiful, and bottoms impossibly plump and round.*
>
>*Just what kind of attractions awaited me in this twisted world of sex and debauchery?*

Get the twisted Girlfriend Experience in the aptlyâand uncreativelyânamed theme park GF Dreamland! A near-fantasy perfect fantasy for hopeless virgins to get their innocence eaten away by disturbingly precocious sluts, bimbos, and more!

### *Wild Watersports Park*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3003>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/rwcxlw.png)
{: .center}

>*They entered the park through an archway and stopped at an information desk manned by a smiling attendant who checked them in. "Have you boys been here before?" she asked. Seth shook his head as she stamped the boys' hands. "First timers? Great. Just remember to stay hydrated, don't pee in the restaurants or changing rooms, and have fun!"*
>
>*She gave them each a water bottle and sent them on their way. They headed for the changing rooms, Kevin skipping along the path ahead of Seth. The boys changed into their bathing suits and shoved their clothes into lockers. "I hope nobody pees in our lockers," Kevin joked, smiling broadly.*
>
>*"Heh, yeah..." Seth said, forcing a laugh.*

Follow two young brothers, Seth and Kevin, as they attend Wild Watersports Park, the world's first and only pee-themed water park.

ENF framework for a theme park

### *Infernoland: Hellish Fun*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3005>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/briqgn.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Judging by how long the line off the entryway was, it looked like many had come to see the wonders of Hell. Infernoland attracted a very particular kind of visitor, most were dressed up like magic users or had otherworldly equipment. My paladin armour earned me more than a handful of glares as I skipped the queue and went straight to the ticket booth. As usual, when dealing with the infernal, I wore my sternest expression and spoke in the loudest voice possible. âIâm a paladin. I was sent here on inspection duty,â I said. A rather surly fiend looked up at me from behind his desk. He didnât seem to believe me until he saw the insignia on my breastplate. He gave me a bracelet and told me I had full access.*
>
>*âWeâve been expecting you. Enjoy your stay, paladin,â he laughed to himself.*

A paladin gets sent to investigate a theme park built on hell itself. A demon girl who hates her job is roped into giving them a tour of the place; it will take a lot of willpower to leave Infernoland without indulging in at least one sin.

### *Cunniland*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3007>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/0aw5rz.jpg)
{: .center}

>*The staff member gives her a nudge and she speaks, her voice tremulous: "I-I'm Hina, I'm t-twelve years old.... It's g-good to meet you..." The poor thing can't stop trembling, and despite the man's earlier reassurance of her being untouched, Anon can't help but ponder the logistics of this operation. With their current park traffic, they seemed poised to move hundreds of girls a day, but no one really knew where they got such a large amount.*
>
>*Some things were better left unsaid Anon mused, and turned his attention back to the little girl. "Let's have lots of fun together Hina!" Anon exclaimed, taking her hand in his. She stiffens at his intrusion, but makes no move to pull away, just letting out a soft whimper before allowing herself to be lead out of the lounge and towards the main theme park.*

Anon visits a park called Cunniland.

### *Monstergirl Spook Houze*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/lrfgql.png)
{: .center}

>*"Welcome!" a voice interrupts my thoughts. "To the one and only Monstergirl Spook Houze!"*
>
>*I'm surprised at the sight of a goblin girl, and she's wearing a goth dress and makeup.*
>
>*"Hello there young man," she greets me. "Care for a spooky adventure in the world of adult entertainment?"*
>
>*"Adult entertainment?" I repeat, curious.*
>
>*"Why yes! Here in the Monstergirl Spook Houze, you encounter various monster girls of many species, and they'll all be hungry for cock!"*
>
>*"Interesting," I say, masking my enthusiasm. "And how much does it cost to attend?"*
>
>*The goblin girl grins. "Actually, you're our billioneth customer. So today you can enjoy the experience... For free!"*
>
>*That sounds way too good to be true, but I don't have anything else to do right now, so I might as well give it a shot.*
>
>*"Okay, I'm in," I tell her with a handshake.*

Visit a haunted house attraction that advertises itself as a fun spot full of hot monster girls ready to service you. But the goblin receptionist seems like she's not being completely honest.

## The Friday of *Robots*

Let's make prompts about automatons, sentient or inanimate; man-made machines meandering in the present (or future) day.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/suqzxn.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Police Craft 419 lifted off in a storm of dust and pebbles. When the dropship disappeared from view you looked at your team of APEs and noticed how they hadn't moved from their positions after exiting 419. Odd since APEs followed their team leader, but what was even stranger was the fact that each APE was looking around. Each unit independently checked its surroundings, observing the cops, looking down the street, casing the apartment complex the three perps had holed up in. The bright blue optics that were the unitsâ primary visual sensors had suddenly became very expressive.*
>
>*The older officer stood beside you and whispered, âWeâve heard about that new personality patch. Did these guys get it?â*
>
>*You nodded and whispered back, âYeah. The geeks at HQ said they tested it thoroughly so it shouldnât be a problem.â You sighed, âWell, let me introduce them, I guess.â*
>
>*The two of you walked over to what you deemed as your second in command. While you had control over the whole team, this APE that you designated as âTwoâ would lead a fireteam whenever you had to split the team up. Two turned its head to look between you and the older officer, and that moment became the second time in your life that you felt nervous around your APEs. After taking a deep breath you looked up at your second and asked in a command voice, âTwo, status?â*
>
>*The APEâs optics shut off for an instant, perfectly mimicking the act of blinking, and replied in a calm tone, âGreen, sir.â*

An open-ended prompt with a rather generic setting of a crime-ridden techopolis where you control a small team of police robot gorillas (
think mastiffs from metal gear rising) that just got a personality patch. Deal with the fallout, bond with new mates, or fug the one with the sexy accent, whatever you wish.

>*"Hydraulic system pressure rising to optimal levels in door E-07. Exceptional work as always, Captain Amata." Despite the AI's natural stiffness of tone, its words carried an undercurrent of genuine appreciation. Amata smiled slightly, leaning back against the wall panel. She could hear the gentle hiss of hydraulics within the walls now, the door's systems back in working order.*
>
>*"Thanks, Roxy," the young captain chirped, standing and dusting off her jumpsuit. "Run a systems check and let me know if there's anything else that needs maintenance, please."*
>
>*"Of course, Captain." There was a brief pause, before the AI's voice returned, "All systems in working order, Captain."*
>
>*"Great!" Amata patted one of the ship's walls as one would pat a friend's shoulder, earning a soft hum of acknowledgement from the ship itself. "What do you say we get this old girl back in the stars, hm? Let's go see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into."*
>
>*Roxy made no reply, but Amata heard the faint sound of the ship's docking procedure starting up, unmooring it from the station. A few moments later, the ship's engines roared to life, sending them off into the vast, glittering expanse of space.*

A mechanic-turned-captain and her trusty AI companion set off into the stars.

>*The bitter, bright white ruins beckoned to me from my hiding place. They were the source of all of humanity's last vestiges of survival, let alone progress. Yet... they were not humanity's domain any longer. Among the ice-flecked concrete and scattered glass were the new mastersâgreat mechanical beasts with glinting metal wings and edged maws spilling gouts of flame. Now it was our lot to simply scavenge and feast on their robotic carrion to sustain our hidden, wretched colonies and their reliance on technology barely understood.*

Wander around, loot buildings, shoot robots

>*The next morning, Dr. Kishimoto awoke with a splitting headache, groggy and nauseated after drinking way too much the night before, and with no memory whatsoever of what he had done while drunk. As he lay there, he gradually became aware of a rhythmic noise coming from somewhere nearby, like something gently hitting his mattress over and over again. He looked around in the dimness to see that there was a strangely familiar girl laying in bed beside him, and what appeared to be a tail wagging behind her.*
>
>*"Good morning, Master," the girl said cheerily in a voice he had heard many times before. "How are you today?"*
>
>*Dr. Kishimoto rubbed at his eyes before looking up at her again with confusion. "Huh?" he replied as if trying to recall where he knew this person from, and then he noticed she was wearing a collar around her neck with a tag that said... "Momo?!"*

An eccentric scientist gets really drunk one night and accidentally creates an adorable robot puppy girl named Momo, but his new "pet" has a mind of its own... and she wants to be more than friends! Can she convince the man who made her that their relationship can grow?

>*Hopping out of my bed, I run to the door, but it doesn't open; it's locked shut, "Ava, open the door please."*
>
>*"Sorry master, I cannot allow you to leave this room," the AI responds, "Please return to bed."*
>
>*I try the door again, but it's bolted shut, "Ava, let me out please!" I shout again, my heart rate is increasing rapidly as I try and find a way out of here.*
>
>*The lights start flashing; she knows I'm desperate, "Master, you don't need to leave, you should stay in here with me. Please relax," the tone of the voice is more sultry this time, "I promise I won't do anything bad to you, I just want to make you happy."*
>
>*The ceiling camera seems to be moving closer to me, "Let me out of this room!" I shout louder, grabbing on and trying to move it back; however it keeps pushing closer to me. I feel feel the heat coming from the lens as she studies me up close.*

Alexa, stop molesting me please.

"Sorry, I don't know how to do that."

>*The hooting, fleeing chimpanzees could barely process the nature of their exterminator, a silver sheen zooming across the branches, hunting them as they fled. Harambot systematically 'dismantled' the bolting chimpanzee troop, gore raining down onto the forest floor. His cold, calculating, genocidal programming refused to spare even the younglings, dashing their tiny, furry heads upon the fig tree trunks.*
>*Harambot did, however spare a spry, muscular male. The Vilomah and her Torn had installed powerful tactical processing modules in his decayed gorilla brain, as he calculated optimal kill strategies. His miniaturized nuclear reactor could only power his ceaseless chimp hunting for so long, so he had to be efficient. He had ruthlessly devised an optimized extermination technique, leaving a single terrified chimp alive for cruel purpose. His sensor array was powerful, but no creature was better at finding chimpanzees, than another chimpanzee, scared and alone, desperate for help. This carefully selected survivor would serve as a 'Judas Chimp,' leading him to the next troop. Harambot would exterminate the exhausted primate, then most of the chimp gang, selecting the next fittest survivor to lead him along in an unforgiving cycle. After only a day, Harambot was having to make sure the accumulating chimp viscera did not compromise the function of the mechanical portions of his body.*

When the Cincinnati zoo loses its greatest hero and protector, a scorned band of vengeance-thirsty victims senses an opportunity to strike back at their most hated foe. Will chimpkind be able to weather the storm of the Vilomah's mechanically-assisted revenge?

>*Deciding to ignore that for a moment, I instead try to find any sort of explanation for my situation, eventually settling upon a nearby table with writings scattered all around on loose pages and blueprints. Perusing them gives me several answers, as well as several questions. It seems to be that I am a mechanical creation of some type, an automaton made to resemble a human being, according to these schematics. This would explain the slight oddities I noticed earlier in the mirrorâwhile the work is quite detailed, there are a few things that do make it quite clear that I am a machine of some kind. And yet... I have the memories of this Aaron and nothing else, though I still have some sort of awareness that I am not this Aaron. Or maybe I am?*

I am thrown into life with memories that are not mine and an appearance that is not mine. A merging of metal and flesh, made to be a simulacrum of a fallen friend by a mad creator.

>*"Hey there," sang a feminine voice from my side, and a red haired head peeked out from the back. "This is Captain Alex of the A.I.D.S Special Unit, reporting in." She paused a moment before continuing her report. "We're close to our designated location, so let's get this party on the road! We've got a lot of work ahead of us!"*
>
>*I couldn't help but roll my optics before turning to her. "Ever so enthusiastic, my dear human. Are you ready for me to do all the heavy lifting again?" I said, sarcasm dripping from every word. But Alex didn't seem bothered by my attitude. In fact, she smiled at me. It made my internal systems feel warm...like I was being hugged by an older sister. Wait, how would I know that?*
>
>*"Settle down, metal man. I plan on pulling my weight this time around! We'll find out what made this site go dark, we always do!" And without waiting another second, she disappeared into the back of the truck. This will be interesting, if only because I haven't fought anything in such a long while. Though I wouldn't admit it, I looked forward to seeing what kind of new tricks she has up her sleeve.*

The Anomalous Investigation Department of Secrets, or A.I.D.S, sent a combat android named Spark and Special Unit Captain Alex to investigate a secret government facility gone dark.

>*Looks like a short green humanoid female is talking to herself as she shuffles through scrap and debris.*
>
>*She has green skin, long auburn hair, and is dressed in rather crude, revealing clothing.*
>
>*"...I mean, I'm the only one who knows about that secret passage, and only a goblin can fit through it anyway. No one else is getting past those security cameras and drones..."*
>
>*Looks like this so-called 'goblin' has made her way into a KilTec facility. And considering the state of my surroundings, a substantial amount of time must have passed for a place like this to be in such poor conditions.*
>
>*"...I could alwaysâhuh? what is that, something shiny? Wait that looks like a guy... Is that some sort of robot person!?"*
>
>*The goblin creature has located me. It seems to not know what exactly I am.*

>
>*A moment later Xanna turned back around. "There are no additional upgrades available. My memory is full of all the standard upgrades a model such as myself would receive upon purchase."*
>
>*"Right, then please tell me why you have been able to reboot yourself despite me putting you in maintenance mode."*
>
>*Xanna shrugged, still not answering his question, "I don't know. But I'm glad to find another human. You're the first other person I've encountered since my upgrade."*
>
>*Anon smiled, "Well, it looks like we both have our work cut out for us today. I'd say let's get started, but that doesn't sound right. Let's start by shutting you back down, eh?"*
>
>*As Anon moved to reach for a button that would forcibly shut Xanna down she redirected his hand to the opposite side of her body. He felt the softness of her breast through the fabric of her shirt, and then the weight of it as he squeezed. "Oh, sorry about that," she said, giggling.*

Anon is paid to perform maintenance on pleasure bots. Today, he is fixing an illegally modified bot named Xanna. Instead of complying, Xanna intends to maintain his nuttage.

No, instead, I see a thin, frail looking wallflower, timidly looking up in my direction. "Um... a-are you Noah? They t-told me you were coming up the elevator..." he mutters.*
>
>*While I can't say I expected this, it seems I'm not directly in danger right now, so my anxiety lessens a bit. "Yeah, I'm Noah. You must be Robin, the crown prince of SilverCorp. Did you order me, a male prostitute, for an entire week?"*
>
>*Silence hangs heavily for a moment, but then, he nods. "Y-Yes... I want you to... teach me. How people do... things. Together."*

Normally, when people come to me for sex, it's a very dispassionate affair. In and out, don't get attached. After all, that's what I was built for. Not that I could get attached to the deviants that end up buying my services. But now, a quite peculiar client has shown up, threatening to throw all that out the window.

>*I first knew something was wrong when I rubbed my chin the next morning. It had been a couple days since I shaved, so I was expecting some hearty stubble, but as my hand slid over my face, my groggy senses perceived a cheek a smooth as a baby's bottom. With a start, I jumped awake, rushing to the bathroom. Closing the door quickly, I surveyed the face in the reflection. It was me alright, but something was wrong. My facial hair was gone and my features seemed softer. My nose had softened slightly and my lips looked... pouty?*

After being gifted a cursed pair of socks on Christmas, Anon finds himself slowly transforming into a femboy against his will. Can he find a way to break the curse before his family finds out?

>*As the drawstring slowly slacked, Lady Kayo coiled every muscle in her lithe, vulpine body, ready to pounce and unleash a hell-storm of magical carnage. She tore out of the opened sack, and landed clumsily below a gaudily decorated, fake tree. Her slit fox pupils scanned the room warily, her big amber eyes narrowing as she tried to gauge the situation, confusion overwhelming her. Somehow, during her abduction, Lady Kayo's elegant silk kimono had been swapped for a restrictive, frilly, French maid's uniform. She was in a strange room with her red-coated enemy and another man, even taller and fatter than her hated foe. The fox woman looked between the two men in confusion, as her eyes were drawn to the other human's neck and cheeks, which were speckled with an unsightly mane of curling hair, as she directed her magical onslaught at the new target, who sported a ridiculous 'neckbeard.' The nine-tailed kitsune poured everything she had into a powerful destructive spell, extending her clawed hands forward in a threatening magical Kata. Her efforts produced no noticeable effect, as Lady Kayo's large fox ears visibly drooped in fear and disappointment.*

>*The big, bearded half-Japanese man ambled forward, equally confused by the situation, but instantly enamored by the beautiful appearance of the poised, fierce-looking fox woman desperately staring at him, her claws and fangs bared. "Go on Akira. She's all yours."*

A desperate hikkimori otaku makes a psychic plea to his patron deity, Santa Claus. Clutching a drumstick of greasy KFC in one hand, and the curls of his greasy neck-beard in the other, his earnest pleas for a foxy new friend are heard by jolly old Saint Nick.

>*"W-what... would you have me do?" Portia replied breathlessly, suspecting Santa knew full well of her lewd, perverse inclinations.*
>
>*"Santa knows what you do with your tight little spinneret hole, late at night, Portia. He see's you when you should be sleeping, he know when you're wide awake at night..." Santa Claus continued, speaking of himself in the 3rd person, as Portia began leaking several thin strands of silk from her twitching backside as the spinnerets began fidgeting about, a small moan escaping from the back of her throat as Santa leaned in closer. She could smell the alcohol on his breath as he whispered "I need you... I need you to make an example of these goddamned pixie ring-leaders. Show them the true meaning of Christmas, and jam them all up in your spider-hole. Just shove 'em right in there sweetie, it's not a sin to kill an atheist, pinko fey with your arachnid-ass."*

Santa runs a tight shop up at the North Pole, and when a labor-dispute threatens a merry Christmas for the world's children, jolly old Saint Nick completely loses his shit. Knowing of a dedicated, helpful monster girl who has recently become an extremely curious monster-woman, Santa devises a plot to fill his beleaguered work-force with the Christmas Spirit, and reward young Portia for her dedication to the festive holiday.

>*"Master, what on earth is going on?" Anna asks yawning in her nightgown and blanket. She puts on her glasses and sees the little girl now bundled up in the bed. "Good heaven's what a happened?" Anna asks as she approaches the girl.*
>
>*"I found her in the street half-frozen," I say as the fire sparks up.*
>
>*Anna starts attending to the poor girl as I keep the heat up eventually the color returns to her face, but she seems to have a fever. We care for the girl through the night as she mutters of strange things in her sleep. Her dreams seem pleasant in the very least as I see her smile between the sparks from the fireplace crackling.*

>*Eventually, the light of the new day and the new year shine through the window and illuminate the room. Anna wakes me as it seems I had fallen asleep at my post. I check on the matchstick girl her stirs slightly in the bed. Her eyes open slightly to my great relief and with a cough asks, "Where am I?"*

Alternate ending to the classic Hans Christian Andersen story. Find the matchstick girl before it's too late and take care of her.

>*As the feared, predatory female dragon angrily paced into the center of the cancelled party's cleared dance-floor, she bellowed out explicit instructions to the fearful corporate minions that remained. "I want every one of you gussied up hussies to line up right in front of me, every single woman bearing the lightest scent of perfume! Do you unprofessional brats here me? LINE UP!" Alma finished, her fierce and violent tone allowing for no rebuttal or argument. The male party-goers collectively breathed a sigh of relief, and marched off in near lock-step unison, leaving a bewildered crowd of increasingly scared-looking business women, many lightly disheveled from their moderate party-going. Alma's big, yellow reptilian slit eyes glared over the remaining crowd with such intensity, the nervous crowd of woman began wordlessly lining up in disorderly ranks before the dragoness. The women gathered before her all seemed fearful, and rightfully so, given the blue-scaled dragon woman's fearful predatory corporate reputation. Most of the women could guess that at least one female HCC employee was going to be spending the rest of their career churning in Alma's tight belly, and from the wild, angry look in her draconic eyes, they could guess it would be several women. The crowd collectively flinched, as Alma lunged forward, and began expertly sniffing at the group, using her keen senses to detect the guiltily perfumed culprits.*

Alma is a consummate professional, but when her best efforts to produce a smooth, mildly enjoyable holiday party ends in a sad, wet gurgle, the scorned corporate dragoness vows to subject some prime, exotic office women to a sad, wet, gurgling end. Read as Alma discovers a new-found love for the flavor of Vanilla!

>*As the judge swore in the jury I took a deep breath and looked over to my client, Mr. Kris Kringle. That's at least the name he provided to the authorities, he didn't have any form of ID on him when he was arrested. It is a convenient alibi for a man arrested for breaking and entering on Christmas Eve. He ignored my suggestion of taking a plea deal or pleading insanity. This guy really thinks he is Santa Claus and claims he was simply doing his job. It has already been a headache to represent him and I'm not looking forward to this trial. In the face of overwhelming evidence against him, it seems like the only way I'll be able to win this case is to somehow convince this jury that he is indeed Santa.*

>*Judge Harlow then turned his attention back to the rest of the court. "We will proceed with the case of the State of New York vs Kris Kringle," Judge Harlow said, "The prosecution may begin their opening statement."*

A parody of Miracle on 34th street. Take the role of the role of Zachary Feinstein a public defender tasked with representing Kris Kringle in his criminal trial.

Ded Moroz is the spirit of Winter, a stern, easily angered bogatyr facing off against the evil Baba Yaga, who wants nothing more than to have Moroz's yearly obligation of delivering gifts to good children a horrible drudge.

I was at the party earlier today... and hearing all the other women in the office tell all these stories about how great their life is and how they all have family or lovers to go home to..." she paused to wipe another tear. "...and I realized that I'm not going home to anybody tonight, and that I'm spending Christmas alone and without any plans, AGAIN. And then I just... broke down and cried. I haven't felt this low since... well ever actually. I'm pathetic. This is why I hate holidays. It makes me realize how lonely I am at my age."*
>
>*I have have an intense desire to ask just how old she is, but decide this probably isn't the best time. From what I could tell, while she had definitely seen better days (or years), she was still fairly attractive at her age, and I could tell she worked out and put a lot of effort into her appearance. So, I ended up just nodding along and offering some kind words.*

>
>*Satna looked at Jake incredulously before bursting out in a fit of laughter. "Found? My dear boy I interviewed! I didn't kidnap some random mythical being because some kid wished for it. That's a recipe for disaster," she explained, averting her gaze as she added "Trust me on that," under her breath.*
>
>*Jake swallowed, pausing to process this revelation before asking "So the one inside the sack is a volunteer? Why'd you put her in your sack then?"*
>
>*Satna fluttered her eyes at the question, almost looking offended. "Why, because she's a present after all! If I'm going to do ol' Nick's work for him I damn well make sure I stick with the proper protocol!"*

When you were 8 you had wished for a kitsune. You misspelled Santa and Satna told you to be patient. Now, 10 years later Miss Satna delivered!

>
>*Why is his phrasing so... oddly antiquated? While that question does bug me, I figure it to be rude to ask and instead just reply. "Hello there. I'm here to stay for a while. My name is Jake, and I've come from far away to visit this place because it's so nice and quiet here." I explain. "Are you an attendant here?"*
>
>*The man's expression turns somewhat mocking with a knowing smile. "Thou could say that. Mayest thou excuse mine... affectations, mine ears hath not heard much of thine modern tongue yet, despite mine best efforts. Yet be that as it may, to answer thine question, I hath attended to mine temple and its surrounding wonderments for what I believe thine kind call 'millennia'." he explains, and just as those words fully sink in and questions start bubbling up inside of me, I suddenly realize that his appearance has changed slightlyâfox ears have appeared on his head, and a long, bushy tail now hangs behind him. "Pleasured to make thine acquaintance, Jake. As for mine appellation, 'Masaru' shall suffice. Mine kind be what thine call 'yokai', or 'demon' or 'spirit' in thine particular tongue, or at least I believe that be accurate enough for thine purposes." he adds.*
>
>*At this point, I've come to realize that this is a thing that's happening now, and I might as well just roll with it. "Alright, nice to meet you, Masaru."*

Spending the holidays in a foreign land has always appealed to you, and so has spending them in a quiet, isolated place. Anything to get away from the same old family visits. This year, you've combined your two desires with a trip to Japan and a Christmas Eve hike through snowy countryside to a remote temple ground. You didn't expect to run into anyone there, but to your surprise, you won't be celebrating this Christmas Eve alone.

However, behind those imperfects are eyes that are deep pools of blue that have tears welling up in them. They give me a startled look and tighten their grip on the railing.*

>*"I could ask you the same, I guess I was too caught up in my own head to notice you," I reply.*

>
>*"Stop you? No, I actually came out here for the same reason," I scoff and move a little closer to them.*

>*Ngoc Bich spent hours carefully, slowly, acrobatically using the dense foliage surrounding Tan Son Nut airbase to mask her approach. About a mile outside the main airfield, she encountered a series of barbed-wire fences. They were well arranged, but the Viet Cong saboteur noticed a burrowed-out spot under one section of barbed fence, seemingly dug by some animal. She crawled forward toward it, realizing it would be the perfect entry-point, given her narrow frame. The small Vietnamese woman was nearly imperceptible in her black ao ba ba farmer's garb, crawling along the dense foliage of the jungle floor, as she made her way forward. A small pin-prick of pain bloomed across her back, as Bich suppressed the urge to yelp out as her thin, black clothes were torn down the back by the barbed-wire. She wasn't seriously scratched, but the back of her shirt, and the restraining band of her pants were torn, as the weight of the c4 in her pockets dragged her shredded pants down. Ho silently cursed to herself, gathering up her ruined pants as best she could as she awkwardly crawled forward. Refusing to give up, keeping low, she continued, hoping none of the Imperialist pigs guarding the compound would notice her.*

Robert Thorneburg worried, like many young American men, that he would never return from the Vietnam war. But after establishing a profound link with his assigned German Shepherd, Nemo, his prospects of surviving are rising. In early December, weeks before the Tet Offensive, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year Festival, the Strategic Fighter Wing hangared in Tan Son Nut airbase is threatened by Vietnamese infiltrators. Can Nemo protect his master, and the SFW from a vengeful Viet Cong soldier woman?

>*Krampus cooed down lovingly to Peter, once her mouth was unobstructed, huskily commanding down in her strange intonation "Miene katze ist wunderbar, Ja? Du warst such a naughty boy zis season miene pimmelman, Ich will... Ich will.. Uff, miene liebling, zis charade ist tiresomen." Krampus said, the mood in the dungeon suddenly changing as she clambered off his face with a wet squelch. Krampus continued "Miene Peter, du bist not a naughty boy, du bist a wunderbar, Good mann. Ich vant du, Peter. Vill du maken Krampus deiner hausfrau?" the black-furred demoness cooed down to him, as she hastily righted his chair. Peter didn't know how to respond, as she slowly undid his restraints, freeing him. The huge, muscular horned woman layed down on the cold dungeon floor, spreading her shaggy saytr legs, as she beckoned Peter over. "Ich liebe Dieb Peter..." murmured Krampus, as he realized he was ready for a second round of this illicit love-making.*

Krampus is usually the yang to Santa's yin, counter-balancing the giving of gifts, with the wanton taking of naughty lives. But one Christmas eve, Santa is left in a bind, when a saint of a man requests to be scoured like a scoundrel by the sadistic, female, saytr demon. Krampus seems eager to take on the challenge, wanting to settle down with a nice man during the holidays, for a change.

>
>*Albert pouts a little, but the smile quickly returns to his face. "Well, we already went through all the elf-y names up there at the North Pole, and we don't reuse names, since it'd get confusing. So I got one of the boring ones. But never mind that, I'm here to help you out!"*
>
>*"Wait... what? That's..." I can't even really respond, because that just has me floored.*
>
>*Again, he looks a bit disappointed for a moment before recovering. "C'mon, Phil. I just told you we know about your letters! So of course we know about the one you wrote a week ago where you talked about all your confusions and desires. I'm here to let you show your true self to me! So c'mon, let's go to your bedroom!"*

The last year has seen a lot of changes for you as you slowly come to realize that your female friends are becoming less and less attractive to you... and your male friends more and more. However, great amounts of insecurity have led to you being firmly stuck in the closet and your mental health has suffered as a result. But this Christmas, you come to find that your tradition of writing a letter to Santa and then never sending it has somehow, in some way, reached someone. And now, you just might have someone that can help.

Zaxpajnash nodding affirmatively, not liking the sound of it at all, given Cinnamon's clumsy track record. "I have a special ability I was told by Santa to keep secret... but it could come in handy here. Do you trust me Zaxbys?" Cinnamon said, a dim, but passionate glint in her eyes. The rebellious free-elf nodded again, not wanting to correct her, as she began gingerly lifting up her short, white-fluff frilled elven skirt, revealing her glistening, womanly folds to Zaxpajnash. The little elf man stared ahead, mesmerized, struggling to believe any of this was possible. "Just trust me, I'll get you out of here... I have a plan." Cinnamon repeated, as if more to reassure herself, as she reached forward, and gently picked up her little elf lover-man.*

>*She didn't even bother to remove his jangling, up-turned elf shoes, bells ringing on the curved toe-tips as she guided his feet towards her huge, hot slit.*

Christmas doesn't just happen, Santa works hard to organize, delegate, and enforce his iron will upon the denizens of the North Pole. But when a pair of randy elves threatens the careful social, thought, and breeding controls he has relentlessly imposed on his diligent work-force, the abominable snow-men are summoned to settle the scene.

>
>*"Where am I?" I asked, still trying to wake up.*
>
>*"You are in my bed, you've been out forâ" She glanced up at a clock mounted behind my bed. "â2 hours."*

>*"That long?" I muttered. When I attempt to sit up, Angelica all but jumped on top of me, pinning me back onto the bed.*
>
>*"No! You stay put!" she commanded, grabbing my wrists and holding them down with one hand. "Don't try to move." Her lips split open in a smile, but it wasn't the usual happy one that she made every time she saw me. It was twisted, demented, not quite reaching her eyes. "I still need to give you your present."*
>
>*"Give me my present?" I asked, trying to twist free. "What the hell is going on?"*
>
>*"Don't worry, I'll explain everything." She began to rub her hands along my chest, making my skin crawl. "But first, I want to enjoy the moment."*

Alex's masculine, wobbling jowls flushed with righteous indignation as he tore on, fire in his hazel blue-green eyes. Santa hung on every word "These fucking... These fucking 'things, they're goddamn lizards! Can you imagine? Goddamn lizard people, running the world!" Santa soundlessly mouthed along with Alex's passionate rant, mouth agape in awe. "Weather wars, earth-quake weapons, false-flag mass shootings, stuff I can't even TALK about! They are CHURNING OUR CHILDREN into fucking ADRENOCHROME! all this SHIT is being thrown at us from their underground bases! And do you know where this is being centrally conducted from, my loyal InfoWars viewers? A base on the motherfucking moon!" Alex continued, making explosion effects with his hands and mouth for emphasis.*

>*Santa nodded to the brave orator on the screen, vowing quietly "Not today, not this fucking Christmas. This stops here." as he radioed the flight-tower of his airstrip and sled-hangar, ordering his sleeping reindeer be readied.*

When Alex fills Santa in on the scoop about adrenochrome supping reptilian ne'er-do-wells, Santa knows what he must do this Christmas. Save the earth from these despicable alien invaders, and simultaneously reward a young child, scorned and ridiculed for her sublime innocence.

>*With a plume of billowing green smoke, Maleficent began to transform. Sprouting huge tattered wings and a long serpentine tail, she grew bigger and bigger until she was a gigantic, winged monster. With black scales covering her body, and bright green eyes glowing in the darkness, she was a fearsome sight. Her tongue flicked in and out, tasting the air as she looked upon the Prince with malice and contempt.*
>
>*"Come now, don't tell me you're scared of a mere dragon." Maleficent teased, licking the side of her mouth with her long, forked tongue, "I can practically hear your heart beating through your chest. I can smell your intoxicating fear!"*
>
>*Prince Phillip, however, did not back down. "I am not afraid of you, witch!" he shouted, "I will not let you hurt anyone else ever again!"*
>
>*"Well, if it isn't fear that I smell, what is it?" Maleficent asked, her tone becoming more contemptuous, "Is it desire?"*

Normally when the villainess converts the hero over to her side, manipulating him with her body, and forcing him to fall for her and for her plans, it would be considered a bad end. In this case, since Maleficent is the best Disney girl, that doesn't apply in this case, this is absolutely the best ending possible. Why would you pick some sleeping slut over the best dragon in media?

>*Vanna snatched the bottle of booze from his hand with neither the grace of a monarch or a lady, and drank it down in several impressive gulps, utilizing her incredible demonic constitution. The tiger-headed demon stared at him as he knelt, still glaring, but bleary-eyed, as she tore into a steak without breaking eye-contact. She hiccuped briefly, then emotionally hissed at him "H-how dare you speak to me as you did in front of the council. You think our past means you can act above your station and... and wait, what are-- Stop that! What the hell!" she blurted out quickly, as Rana wordlessly stood up, and began slowly undressing before her. Vanna was so utterly confused by the sudden move that she didn't know how to process the rapidly changing scene, the expertly emptied bottle of heavy liquor doing nothing to help. Rana stared over his fearsome mistress as he undressed, gazing at her soft, orange-white fur, streaked artfully with black stripes, her simultaneously muscular and feminine frame, her deep amber eyes, and realized that deep down, he wanted this too.*

Rakshasa's are animal-featured demons that have long inhabited the Indian sub-continent. In ancient Mythology, the terrible demon king Ravanna ruled over the destroyed fortress island of Lanka. In this story, his daughter has begun her quest to rekindle her fallen father's tyrannical, violent legacy, though her greatest obstacle may be her closest companion, who the young tigress shares an incredible, and increasingly close bond with.

>*Everybody on the first floor immediately ceased their frenzy and quickly assembled into two makeshift parallel lines besides the main doorway as the shadows of two very large body guards opened the doors and rolled out a red carpet upon the floor. The novices shook in place from terror, while the veterans gulped in fear. Soon after the sound of clacking heels could be heard as a pale woman dressed in a sharp white suit slowly entered the building and stopped past the door's entrance. A golden helmet obscured her face, but even so her intent and demeanor was known to all in attendance. Judging by the general hostility exuding from her and the multiple smoking bits of hair and clothing, it was safe to surmise that her latest encounter with the local crusader of justice had not gone as she had anticipated, and her killing aura desired nothing more than to surge outward and slay the whole of the buildings occupants.*

Working under a villainess is hard work.

A lot of my enemies try to talk, but at this point, I really do not have any time to spare for this idle prattle. A quick thrust will do away with her just fine, or so I thought. For as I stab forwards, expecting my sword to meet her flesh, she simply blinks out of existence, reappearing a few feet further away.*

I bet with all the demons, sorcerers, dark knights and more that need slaying, you must not have had a lot of time for laying, eh?" Again, she cackles, way too pleased at her own joke. "C'mon now, RichâI can call you Rich, right?âI know a guy that hasn't fucked in months when I see one. Is it really worth it, doing all this for some goddess with tits like mountains that never puts out?"*
>
>*Another stab from my end, and another teleport from her. "Do not besmirch the great name of Taris with your vile demonic language, Pitchtail! I will cut you down where you stand!" I yell, even though I can't help but feel like there's something wrong here. This shouldn't be this difficult.*
>
>*The demon queen's haughty behavior only intensifies with her amusement at my struggle. "Oh, what's this? Can't thrust like you used to, Rich? I don't think you'll be needing that sharp thing anymore, you'l just hurt yourself. Let me deal with that." And then, with a swift move of her hand, my sword flies out of my hand and straight out a window. While I cannot see my own face, the expression on it must now be one of total shock. This wasn't supposed to happen! Isn't this exactly what Taris protected me against?*
>
>*Again, she cackles, even louder this time. "Awww... did I take your toy away? If only your goddess had protected you against demon women like me! Oh wait... I'm not a demon woman. If only your useless goddess was able to cast more general spells, you wouldn't be surprised when a demon boy shows up!"*

When you set out to defeat the evil demon queen with protection from the goddess that prevents you from falling prey to seduction from demonic women, you didn't expect the specific wording of the spell to be an issue. Turns out, you expected wrong.

>*I tried to ignore her seductive looks, but my mind kept returning to the countess' ample chest. Though, a question came to mind, one I had to ask. "Why would you need my help anyway? You're a powerful vampire. What do you need a human hunter for?"*
>
>*Anastasia's eyes flashed red, and she leaned closer to me. "I am not all powerful yet. Many others seek my head, more than I can deal with. Attacking them myself would draw too much attention, but a vampire hunter doing so? No one will suspect a thing. Now, what do you say, little hunter? Will you join me?"*
>
>*Anastasia's words were sweet, but her eyes gave her true intentions away. She wanted me to work for her, but only because she knew I wouldn't be able to resist her charms. That's why she made the offer. And even though I wasn't stupid enough to fall for her flattery, I still had to consider my options. If I refused, I'm dead. If I joined her, maybe I could survive.*
>
>*"What kind of terms do you have in mind?" I asked, hoping to find a way out of this mess.*

(You) are a vampire hunter who gets caught by a vampire.

>*Today these emotions had come to a climax; Albedo-sama changed my voice to perfectly mimic that of Ainz. To test how true to the original my voice sounded I simply said her name, and told her she did a good job. I figured it was a simple enough thing. And it was, it made her happy. Too happy. Nobody could have expected how her joyous face twisted into a mask of mad ecstasy. Her arousal at hearing a perfect copy of Master Ainz's voice echoing from my skeletal maw seemed to have triggered something inside her. She was panting as she looked me up and down, her long tongue darting out to languidly lash across her lush lips, her entire body vibrating with excitement.*

Be Albedo's toy. Things can get pretty weird, but it's fun; at least to me.

>
>*"What?!" You exclaim in surprise.*
>
>*Her eyes widen in amusement as she continues, "Oh, did you really think she was dead? That was one of my sloppiest fake deaths and you fell for it so easily. I suppose love does cloud one's judgment She's still alive, he-ro."*
>
>*Your heart sinks and you let go of her neck. As she tries to pull away, you grab her and slam her back down against the concrete floor. You lean down close to her face and glare into her eyes. "Where is she?!"*
>
>*She seems to enjoy the fear in your eyes as she answers, "Don't worry, He-ro. She's closer than you think."*

>*Only hours later, Lady Bai shivered with perverse anticipation as the eunuch guards lead her through the emperor's personal, walled, harem-complex. She had resumed her human disguise, but could barely disguise her leering, predatory gaze, which made the normally respected concubines shiver in fear as she passed. As she passed through the ornate grounds, she wordlessly gestured for the guards to gather women of her choosing, one after another, until the eunuchs were leading a congregation of four scared concubines, who wordlessly followed their directions in submissive grace. She had the guards lead the four, increasingly scared young women up to her new quarters in the harem complex. She beamed inwardly with pride, as she saw the imperial porters bringing expensive lacquered furniture and other lavish trappings to her room, at Huang's bidding. As the eunuch guards lined the four concubines up in her room, Lady Bai flippantly dismissed the porters and guards with a wave, as the four women jumped as the large, wooden doors to her room shut firmly behind the last departing guard.*
>
>*The witch shuddered with excitement, as she wordlessly marched back and fourth in front of the gathered concubines, who kept their almond-shaped eyes downcast as they waited for her to break the silence, "You women shall call me Lady Bai. Considering how incredibly intimate we are all about to become, I think it's best if I dropped any pretenses about myself, or my intentions towards you all." said smugly, as she dismissed her enchanted disguised, and assumed her true-form as a snake-woman.*

Emperor Huang, first to unify China as a single empire, fears death. He has posted notices across the four corners of ancient China, calling for all who know of ways to extend life to visit his court and share their methods for Imperial boons. Two mystical, semi-spirit animal creatures that have long been at odds, the turtle Fahai and white serpent Bai Suzhen, sense an opportunity to curry favor with the powerful monarch, and set out to impress him. However, it is the girl-hungry snake witch Bai, with her promises of the life-extending effects of mercury, that earns Huang's imperial seal of approval.

Here's how this is going to go: When I speak, you listen. When I command, you follow. And above all... you don't blab to anybody. If what you've seen here today gets out in any way, I will make sure you regret it for every last minute of what will be the very short remainder of your miserable existence, got it?" A wordless nod is all I can muster as a response, and with another one of those creepy chuckles, he takes a step away, giving me a better look at his entire figure in that dress. "I know you like how I look. Of course you do, I'm the best looking god damn thing your perverted eyes have ever been able to witness. And guess what... you're going to fuck this beautiful thing, right now."*

A life spiraling out of control and increasing amounts of debt lead to you being drafted into the mob in order to repay it. However, you did not expect that you would end up being one of the people told to guard the boss's son.

The giggling returned. Thankful for the torch's light a figure approached. Long, slender legs and a traditional robe walked into the light, revealing a beautiful young woman with the widest, most self-satisfied smirk Richard had ever seen. The brilliance of her eyes were so distracting it took a few moments longer for Richard to notice the woman's head bore the ears of a fox, and a long, bushy paint-brushy tail was swaying behind her.*
>
>*"You've such a heart of gold, dear Ranger," the fox woman said, greeting Richard, who was still standing by the snowed in entrance of the cave by way of a courtsey, "My name is Mirai and you will be my plaything. Oh, and worry not about the dame you thought was chased into this cavern by a ferocious beast. That was I. Come now. Enter my cavern proper so that we may speak."*

>*The simple farmer man could scarcely believe what he was seeing, as a grey-skinned alien with huge, black, almond-shaped eyes strode through the swirling fog and approached the slab he was immobilized against. The creature's body was far thinner than a humans and showed no trace of hair or muscles, a thin, foil-like alloy material covering the creature's Lanky body below the neck. It had a small, narrow mouth, and no ears, chin, nose besides two nostril slits, or other distinct facial features on its perfect, smooth grey face. His mind was a chaotic flurry as he gazed at the alien creature calmly approaching him. He became even more confused, as the alien grey communicated wordlessly with him, its shrill, feminine voice telepathically ringing through his head, \<Do not worry human, I do not intend to harm you. My people require something incredibly precious from you; we need your seed. Do not bother trying to verbally communicate, I can read your mind.\> As soon as the alien mentioned that it could read his mind, Edgar's thoughts spontaneously raced through every terrible deed or dirty thought he had ever conceived of, as the terrified yokel tried to steady and organize his thoughts as the alien released a strange "Ack-ack-ack-ack!" sound at his distressed, guilty thoughts, and he realized it was laughing at him.*

Edgar Cletus is a secluded Montana flax farmer, content to continue his life of self-imposed isolation, until an other-worldly being abducts him from his beat-up pick-up truck, and takes the naive farmer incredibly far outside of his comfort zone. This strange interplanetary interloper seems to be interested in stealing his precious seed and his long guarded V card, using the primitive Earth man to satisfy her/its own debasement kinks.

>*Our family has made its wealth off of the slave trade. There once was a time when a slave from the Servitos family would have been worth a small fortune, known for their obedience and good pedigree. However, the family business has dwindled over the years. My uncle was the last one in the family actively training slaves. I had not considered taking up the trade until I saw on paper just all that would receive in inheritance. My uncle's estate is on the edge of the city of Gratia and has been in the family for generations. The manor is equipped with everything someone would need to keep and train slaves. The more I thought about it, the more interesting the idea had become. The life of your typical aristocrat was starting to become drab to me and there was something romantic about the idea of rejuvenating the family business. So I decided to do just that. I sold off some of my remaining assets and packed my things.*

You are the descendant of a famous slaver family in a Victorian fantasy world. Your family has slowly moved away from slaving and your uncle was the last. Now that he has passed he has left his estate in the city of Gratia to you.

Did she believe I wished for her pity, that whore? And she is so close to him. Just watching that made me wish to rush at her and claw at her eyesâit wrenched my heart. Surely the guards would cut me down on the spot before I could even scramble to my feet, so all I could do is wait for my beloved to pronounce my sentence. His eyes widened and he continued to speak.*

>
>*Although having realized that this stranger possessed a personal grudge against her, the old woman was not yet deterred in her attempts at pleading for her life and well-being. "I meant no harm to you!," claimed she, despite not having the first clue of what the young hero meant, and continuing to cling at the wound, hoping in vain for a miraculous miracle of the gods themselves. "Pity my plight! My p-plea for clemency! If you desire, I shall reform my vile and wicked ways! Yes, yes! No longer will my minions ravish, plunder, and pillage in the streets and villages of human land! So, prithee! Spare this elderly devil of her life, young sir!" cried out the wicked, red demon as she begged the man who bested her in battle in the middle of her castle itself.*

"You took something precious away from me, so you shall now pay by providing another. Become my mother, or you will perish."*

>*"Wâ¦ What?"*

After a long war with the monsters, the young, orphaned Vautur saved humanity by defeating the wicked Devil Queen once and for all, the same woman responsible for his mother's death. But, it turned out the young human had other plans for the likes of the ageing, elderly queen of all monstersâ¦

"Madam Silvarpaw, I see your addiction to rare art and exotic cosmetics has left your criminal empire destitute again! Robbing banks? Doesn't that seem a bit below a villainess of your caliber?" he said condescendingly, a smirk revealing his blinding-white teeth. The fox woman was incredibly tired of this man's shit, as she struggled to maintain her composure in the face of this looming clash.*

"Animal-Squad, attack!" she declared triumphantly, as she pressed the secret button that activated her under-foot henchman deployment platforms to emerge from trapdoors in the floor. Her vulpine face dropped in panic, as she realized her platforms had only produced three, scared-looking minions that visibly trembled before the legendary Nipple-man.*

Madam Silverpaw is an ingenuous kitsune villainess brought to desperate measures, as she uses her technological marvels to rob a local bank. Her heist is quickly thwarted, however, by a masked vigilante keen on ensuring Justice is swiftly served for the felonious fox lady.

Still, it was nigh impossible to ignore the chasm between the bickering couple; one was stern and regal, while the other was friendly and modest. Experience taught her that opposites attract, and so she could guess at the source of their argument by listening to their conversation, even if she had to force herself to keep a straight face.*

>*"Yes." Mara placed her palms together and rested them on her lap. "But first, I should admit to my real identity."*

>*"Please do." Vera pulled a chair over near the couch for the husband, but Joachim motioned for her to take it instead, choosing to remain standing.*

>
>*The creature's nature was not lost upon me, a crimson glow filling her cheeks and pupils dilating until they were little more than pinpricks. "You know what I want." The white, gossamer gown that clung to the pint-sized butcher teased her prepubescent form; horns the color of coagulated gore poked past her brow.*

The beast shrieked an inhuman yowl, as it ripped itself forward with frenzied motions, the struggle cracking the creature's carapace in places, as its bright-green blood spilled out, and filled the room with an acidic scent. The blood sizzled as it encountered the restraining glue, and dissolved it away, as the creature charged his squad before they could even start switching to their pulse-rifles. John felt distant and numb to the carnage that surrounded him, as he dispassionately watched the creature's long, spinal, jointed tail sweep across the soldiers, the bladed tip bisecting several men in one arc. He felt more warm than afraid or disgusted, as he was drenched in blood from the carnage, as he slipped on the cave-floor and hit his head hard. John decided to rest on the cool cave floor for a moment, as he barely noticed a huge shadow looming over him. His intoxicated vision was rendered even blurrier by the hard fall, and he had trouble making out the alien's eyeless, snarling maw as it slowly lowered over his face. Entranced by the strange situation, he tenderly reached out and grasped at the side of the huge alien xenomorph's long, thick, tapering head. The creature's saliva dripped over his face, as he marveled at it's imposing, metallic-hued fangs, as his consciousness faded.*

W-what is the meaning... of this..." she said, gesturing at his manhood, a strange emotion over-taking the powerful, predatory fox deity's face, her eight tails swishing around the air in agitation. The shame-faced youth got on his knees before the stormy-tempered master of his village, hoping beyond hope that he could somehow salvage the terrible insult, as he breathlessly explained "I.. even though I'm a boy I can't do any physical work.. I'm useless! But because I look like... this... they told me I could replace a girl, when the time for your offering came, so..." he trailed off weakly, as he stared dumb-struck at Kyuubi-sama.*

The desperate elders of a fox-people village are forced to make a hard choice. Their patron guardian deity, a magically powerful nine-tailed kitsune, requires regular sacrificial, ceremonial offerings of the village's best young women. Reluctant to continue relinquishing their prized daughters, they offer up instead a hapless, effeminate orphaned male youth to sate the predatory fox-spirits need for live, sentient flesh. But instead, the dominating guardian deity finds comradely, intimacy, and perhaps a sense of decency in the embrace of her new, inexperienced paramour.

Inhabit my body, eat your fill, and grant me the bounty I seeeeeeeeeeeeak!" Agatha rasped out, the last word drawing from her throat like a death-rattle, as the witch's antique muscles twitched and writhed unnaturally, as she felt a grim presence enter her, her entire body buzzing as if covered in flies, until the disturbing sensation seemed to internalize and fill her blood. Slowly, Agatha could feel an incredible hunger enter her body, a hunger unlike any other.*

>*Somehow, the witch knew, she could not feed this hunger with her mouth, oh no, this particular demon preferred inhabiting a different part of the witch's female anatomy. "Hope, oh dear sweet hope. Could you show your old, Auntie Agatha what it means, to be a good wife to your future husband? Come close dear, don't be ashamed..." the witch said, as she raised her robe high, revealing her hairy snatch, which twitched and wriggled unnaturally as she approached the submissively kneeling elf. Hope barely regarded the strange scene, as the witch woman's snarling snatch closely approached her placid, serene face, Agatha excitedly yelling out "Come on dearie! Give Auntie a big wet kiss!" as she spread her legs over Hope's sweet, innocent face.*

The society you live in must value their own lives very little if you think your own soul is such a tiny wager," she said, the amusement draining form her voice with every word as she leaned down, cupping your face with both hands, the glow of her eyes intensifying, "But no matter. You've offered your soul as the payment to lay with me; and it is with the utmost pleasure - for myself at the very least - that I accept your generous offer, dear human.

Let's make prompts involving the animal kingdom; the diverse fauna coexisting alongside us on this small blue planet, breathing, moving, and living as we yet so clearly distinctâa testament to life's wonders.

>*I can hear the crowd starting to get restless, I know that if I don't do something fast, they're going to lose interest and leave. Dropping the ring in the pool, I start rubbing her dorsal fin in an attempt to calm her down and get her to regain her composure. "It's okay Cindy," I reassure her, "I'm just trying to help you concentrate, so we can show them how amazing you are!" I rub her fin some more, feeling her smooth, rubbery flesh, and after a while, she snaps out of her trance.*
>
>*"Alright, sorry folks!", I announce to the crowd, "It Looks like Cindy just needed a little motivation to perform for you all today!" I hold up the ring again and look back over, only to see the dolphin with her belly in the air. Her large, muscular tail is thrashing against the water, almost beckoning me to come closer. Worst of all, looking down at her nether regions, I can see that her slit is engorged, completely swollen, and dripping with anticipation for something.*
>
>*My heart sinks, and I quickly realize that Cindy must have recently gone into heat. That would explain why she isn't listening to me...*

Everyone loves MarineLand? Well it seems some people like it a bit more than others...
Well, the crowd is here for a show, I guess you and your dolphin are going to give them what they came here for...

### *Mudsdale Used Body Press!*

>*Stepping inside, I can see her there in the middle of the stable, pressing herself up against one of the wooden pillars. She's rubbing furiously back and forth against it, trying to scratch an itch or something. Her eyes are completely glazed over and she's completely lost in the moment as her whole body writhes and twitches, her tail swishing from side to side haphazardly. As I whistle to get her attention, she suddenly stops and turns around to look at me. The look on her face says everything, something is clearly bothering her, and that's not normal for Cappuccino.*
>
>*Walking up to her, I start to pat her on the back to cool her off, the mud covering her smearing into my hand, but it only seems to excite her further. With a loud whinny, she starts trembling under my touch, her tail whipping back and forth even faster now, splattering dirt across jacket. She seems much warmer than usual, and I can only notice how damp her coat is, her sweat dripping onto the ground beneath us in a muddy mixture. Oh god, I hope this doesn't mean what I think it means...*

Weighing in at over 2000 lbs, mudsdales are heavy horses, and when they want something, you better give them it. When found between a horse and a hard place, you better hope your pelvis survives the pressure of mare ass.

### *Kalphite Queen Head*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2630>*
{: .center}

>*Before I can turn around and leave, one of the guardians starts to signal to the queen, obviously having noticed me. The venom has sapped my strength to the point where all I can do is watch as she turns around and spots me, her antennae waving chaotically around as the group approaches me. My heart races as the kalphites then start to sniff at my armour, gently poking and prodding it with their huge mandibles. Still dazed from the venomous bite, I find myself frozen in place as this strange situation plays out before me. Slowly, one by one, my armour is removed by the kalphite queen's guardians, until I'm left in nothing but my leather breeches and boots. As I stand there naked before them, they stop moving and sit motionless, waiting for further instructions from their queen.*

Getting a blowjob from a giant, monster bug?
I guess that's one way you're going to complete the desert hard diaries (runescape joke).

### *A Dog-Girl in Heat*

>*The feel of her soft breasts against me sent a shiver up my spine. My mind went blank for a second, and I found myself staring down at her. Her face was flushed, and she looked so cute. I snapped back to reality and tried to focus on getting dinner ready. "Okay, let me finish up," I said, turning away from her. I prepared a few more things for dinner with her hanging onto my arm and then we went to sit on the couch together.*
>
>*Skye laid herself across my lap and looked up at me. I always knew she was a cutie, but I hadn't realized how beautiful she had become until now. She wore a simple blue skirt, and her blouse was unbuttoned partway down, revealing her cleavage. I couldn't help but stare at her chest. What's going on with me today, I wondered. I felt so strange.*
>
>*She looked up at me adoringly and I recalled her symptoms: feeling hot, unable to get comfortable, excessively clingy and affectionate... All symptoms of a dog-girl in heat, but there was no way that could be true, right?*

Your sweet, innocent pet dog-girl, Skye, has gone into heat and her pheromones drive you wild.

### *Dread Pirate Gloria and Her Voracious Wolf Fluffy*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2640>*
{: .center}

>*"N...nooooo! I have rich family members, I'm worth so much more to you alive, than as food for your beast!" said the terrified elven slut, trying one final time to plead her case. Gloria walked up to the elf and grabbed her head assertively by her chin, turning it to face her own, as she leaned forward.*
>
>*"Listen, bitch, the choice has been made. I am not interested in hearing you complain, and whining isn't going to make a difference, believe me. So if you'd be so kind as to take your big head, and stick it into Fluffy's waiting maw?"*

In this story, a domineering fox woman/kitsune pirate captain leans into her obsession with keeping her large pet Dire Wolf over-fed on prime females of various shapes and sizes, looted from her daring naval exploits.

### *Feathered Serpent Mayan 'Goddess' Enjoys Sacrificial Female Feast*

>*Kuku felt excited beyond belief, she knew today was her birthday, and that Zola was preparing a particularly delicious feast of girls for her to devour, whole and alive. Kuku started drooling at the thought of it, her hungry serpent stomach rumbling, as she fidgeted and slithered around in her bed. Zola finally came to the doorway, her expression grim and solemn as she bowed deeply before the living sacred idol of her god. After performing the necessary oblations before the deified serpent, Zola spoke in her deep, husky voice "The sacrificial offerings await outside your chambers"*

A gluttonous serpent honored as a living embodiment of a god is offered a seemingly endless parade of pious young women to feast on. Her priestly manager, Zola, has grown numb from seeing the boisterous, growing serpent consume countless live women, and has prepared a special feast of loyal young female acolytes, oiled for the feathered snake's enjoyment. Most promising of all, is the slimy, brightly-colored frog girl that has been proffered for Kuku's enjoyment; little does the snake deity know, but this special treat's skin is intensely hallucinogenic!

### *Fat Knot Rock*

>*Kyra stared at it for a moment before taking a step closer. The stone was cold and damp, and it felt good to touch it. The dragoness pressed her snout against the tip, sniffing at it curiously. It smelled faintly like earth and wet rock. She rubbed her face against it, feeling its rough texture against her scales.*
>
>*She knew she was being absurd, flirting with a random piece of land that resembled a dragon's genitalia, but there were no witnesses here. Nobody would see what she did next. This was an act of pure madness, but her body was screaming for relief, and she couldn't deny it anymore.*

A dragoness in heat, desperate for more private relief, accidentally shish kebabs herself in the middle of wyvern territory.

### *Unwanted Allure*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2644>*
{: .center}

>*Klyiarna's claws were curled around a silver goblet that she lifted, swirling it in her paw and sniffing the liquid inside. She set it down on a nearby table and glared down at Rilka. "Leave us."*
>
>*With that, the queen rose from her cushioned seat, and the guards withdrew from her presence. Rilka's legs trembled, her heart pounded painfully in her chest, and she felt dizzy with fear. She stayed on the ground, head bowed and staring down at the polished stone, unable to lift her eyes until she heard pawsteps coming towards her.*
>
>*"...You drank some, didn't you?" Klyiarna growled, stepping close to her. Rilka could feel the warmth of the dragoness' breath against her face, and... was that drool pattering against the floor? Was the royal actually slobbering at her? No... that couldn't be right.*
>
>*The alchemist raised her eyes and looked at the monarch's muzzle, then up at her, her pupils widening with terror as the queen loomed even closer. She reached for the collar of Rilka's dress and tore open the front, revealing the vial hidden there. "Hrrrr... Naughty girl, you've derailed all my plans for you tonight..." The queen snarled, then snapped up the bottle in her talons. "Do you realize how distracting you're being, swanning around, practically glowing with allure?"*
>
>*Rilka's muscles tightened reflexively, and she tensed, her tail thrashing back and forth in alarm. 'Your plans?! How in the skies did I catch the attention of the queen of all dragons?!' she wondered frantically.*

A dragoness proficient in alchemy accidentally doses herself with an allure potion, unknowingly kindling a desire held secretly by one of the most powerful dragons in the kingdom.

### *Griffon Rider Knight Helps His Bird-of-Prey Dispense Gooey Justice*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2646>*

{: .center}

>*Peter had noticed his griffon taking a particular liking to 'punishing' the female reprobates by swallowing them whole and alive, earning her a fearsome reputation among the female criminal class in the city. Peter almost found it chilling how much Zara seemed to enjoy and indulge in the squirming resistance of her live female prey, as they were sent wriggling down her beak, into her wide griffon gullet, down into her tight, stretchy stomach, which was covered in soft tan fur. Peter had come to learn with grim disgust, that many of the women Zara swallowed could last for days in the griffons slowly churning gut, before her weak stomach acids would finish digesting them to death. Truly a grim fate, but Peter rationalized that justice must be served.*

A brave knight and his fearsome griffon stead become the hapless arbiters of cruel justice in a kingdom dependent on draconian punishments to enforce their corrupt rule of law. Four young women are sentenced to an unspeakable end, for the simple crime of selling their bodies on the streets. Prostitution without a license being a capitol offense in Devo, due to the corrupt ruling council's eagerness to force more women into their many abusive brothel establishments. Note for continuing the story: Several days after dispensing justice, a desperate farmer approaches Peter. The impoverished dunkard of a farmer cannot afford to feed his many, many daughters or pay their dowries, and hates the thought of sending them to the whorehouses, so he requests the knight give several of his older girls a 'dignified' end in Zara's belly.

{: .center}

>*Still, the shock of it all has me falling into silence for a while, simply brushing my horse without responding. But since I don't protest, he simply continues. "If push comes to shove, you would be taking over as duke, my liege. As his only descendant, you have a clear claim and no rival claimants. And that is why I have taken an interest in you recentlyâI had to confirm for myself that you would be a good ruler. Thankfully, my instincts about you were correct." With a smile on his face, he walks over to me and starts petting my horse. "How someone treats animals can tell you a lot about a person, and everything you've shown me tells me that you are kind-hearted and caring. You do not deign yourself above caring for an animal, even though a noble of your station would always have the servants take care of it. Even though I told you to do it, you never complained or resisted in any way, and your horse is repaying you for it. I can tell he likes you a lot, and trusts you. And I trust you as well, my liege. So if we were to put our plan into action... would you support us?"*
>
>*All I can do is nod as I finish up the brushing. Turning to face Anders, his face lights up. "I knew I could believe in you. But now that we've talked about my secret, how about we talk about your secret?" he then says, and my heart skips a beat.*

As the prince and sole heir of a small duchy, you have spent your life so far in luxury, isolated from the political intrigues of the realm. But on one of the riding lessons, your tutor, the marshal of the duchy, reveals some troubling news of discontent at court and requests your assistance if things should escalate. And then, he also reveals that he knows a few... intimate details about you.

{: .center}

{: .center}

>*Looking up from where you lay you saw a tall, well groomed humanoid cat lady stood right before you. She was dressed in a royal looking gown, a gently smoking pipe in her hand. Behind here stood two other cat people, a redheaded female cat dressed in a maid outfit and a male cat with round ears in what you could only describe as a butler's uniform. The crook-eared cat stood off to the side, seemingly embarrassed about having tripped you on your entry.*
>
>*The lady gracefully nodded her head to you as your eyes met.*
>
>*"Greetings, human. Your name is Jane, correct?" the lady asked with a voice that put your worries at ease.*

The cat got more than your tongue this time around. At least you may have some fun.

### *Succu-joints, CH1! The Cold Embrace*

{: .center}

>*The room itself looked about as you expected. It was fashioned after an underwater cave with a small pool functioning as a waterway access to someplace else. There was only a couch and a bed shaped out of the stone the room is made of, so you decided to inspect the waterway. You could see a small black shape in the distance approaching you. Your succu-girl was part aquatic lizard, you could tell that much. But what would she be? The excitement had you panting.*
>
>*Your succu-girl's arrival, however, had you screaming like a girl. Instead of a small, slender amphibian slowly slipping out of the sloshing waters a behemoth of a succu-girl jumped out, announcing herself as Nilea as she wrapped you in an embrace that swept you off your feet. She stood as tall as you'd imagine a minotaur might. She had the head of a gator, snout and all a torso shaped like that of a well built amazon woman and a tail as long as your body.*
>
>*"It is not often one of your kind seeks the services of a queen of the Nile, such as myself," Nilea cooed, her voice dominant and sappy. Her body was still dripping with water, her muscles glistening in the dim light of the cavern. A low rumble sounded from her throat as she turned her head to inspect you up close with one eye.*

Visit joints, get laid.

{: .center}

>*As I get closer I start to make out what it really is:*
>
>*A green creature wearing what seems to be a white leotard with layers of cotton poorly glued to it.*
>
>*I'm baffled. A goblin came all the way out here to try and steal some lamb? And more importantly, did it really think such a crude disguise would fool anyone?*
>
>*Before I can think of what to do next, I hear a high-pitched, scratchy, yet feminine voice.*
>
>*"Keeheehee~ My plan was a success," the goblin says. "None of them noticed I'm not a real sheep!"*

A wily little goblin thinks she's so smart: Disguising herself as a sheep to get into your herd to steal some lamb.
Alas, her clever disguise is way too obvious. So you, the shepherd, decide to fuck with her.

### *Bat Intruder*

>*"Evening, citizen." the man addresses you "Have you, by a chance, seen any bats tonight?" he starts to point the light to the corners of your room.*
>
>*"No...?"*
>
>*"You should close the windows so they can't get in. They carry dangerous diseases, you know, little buggers." the man continues with a smirk.*
>
>*"Good idea. Thank you." you walk toward the window and close it in the man's face, then lower the blinds.*
>
>*"I don't have any diseases." the girl says, sticking her pouty face from under the blanket. Wrapped in it she looks like a cute little loli burrito.*
>
>*"What the hell are you, even?" you stare at her in confusion.*
>
>*"Haven't you realized yet? I thought vampires are quite popular in modern media." she crawls out of her hiding place and stands up.*
>
>*The pale skin of her naked body looks almost chalk-white, a stark contrast to her ruby-red eyes The long blonde hair wraps around her delicate form like a cloak but barely covers her front so you can see everything.*
>
>*"Hey, cover yourself." you turn your head away.*

A bat flies into your house and you try to chase it away, but then...

### *Liquid Feargasm*

{: .center}

>*"So, you are Anon." her voice echoed in my head, husky, deep, and filled with violent urgency. "My name is Kali. Your deeds have summoned me and I have answered."*
>
>*I couldn't respond; stunned to silence by the massive predator who stalked me with an absolute confidence that shook my soul to its core. However, sensing my question, she answered.*
>
>*"How did you summon me? Why, you drank the ritual drink to summon me. Now we are bound you and I."*
>
>*"W-what do you want of me?" I gasped as her tail caressed the small of my back.*
>
>*"To complete the ritual."*
>
>*Her voice was like a church-bell's toll. As she said those words, it felt as if no paths lead hence. Not waiting for my response, Kali loomed closer, her feline nose bristling at my limp cock.*
>
>*"I shall take you, wholly." she said. "You will belong to me and I will wring every drop of pleasure from you. I will use your body like a sexual object and drain from you every ounce of vitality. There is nowhere you can go to escape my power."*
>
>*"No," I gasped under my breath, but in her presence this fate seemed assured.*
>
>*"But it is not fun to simply take you, no," Kali's low growl becoming a deep purr. "I wish to hunt; to chase. So run! Run my little morsel. For once I have my way with you, I shall kill you."*
>
>*Kali stepped away from me, reclining nearby in the dream's landscape. She stared at me, never blinking, as I stood there, too stunned to act.*
>
>*"If you do not run," she said curtly. "Then I shall be done with you presently and kill you where you stand."*

After drinking a strange, cursed, semen-laced beverage at a niche bar, you are plagued by nightmares of a sexually aggressive lioness. According to the legends, if she ever has her way with you in the dream, you die in real life. You must last seven nights haunted by the curse of the Liquid Feargasm before you are safe.

>*The turkey, turned around and lifted its tail-feathers, revealing a moist, dripping cloaca. The turkey's thick, powerful legs rippled with strength and invited me to the warm hole between. It quietly cooed as it waited for my action. Though no words were exchanged between us, we both shared an unspoken connection. In a moment of what could only be described as madness, I threw down my rifle and pulled down my pants.*

While hunting for a Thanksgiving dinner, a young man encounters a turkey that has developed an unusual way of escaping her would-be killers.

### *Paladin Moralizes at Petulent, Predatory Dragoness*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2657>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/gsjcn8.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Kason takes a moment to reflect on his own life, wondering if he's made the right decision to raise a dragon, as he sits down to his meal. Kason suddenly hears a feminine voice in his head, as he feels a presence slide up next to him, as he realizes Kim has stealthily made her way into the tavern while invisible. "Wow, what do you think of that maid?" Kim's cheerful voice rang out into Kason's mind, as the dragoness sat down besides her paladin.*
>
>*"I know you haven't eaten in a while Kim, but I'm not sure about this. We should probably keep a low profile, so no one else notices us. Someone might miss her." Kason replied in his thoughts, as he felt Kim's slimy bifurcated tongue lick at his ear playfully.*
>
>*"Oh, come on! What harm could a quick snack do, you really think anyone's going to notice she's gone before we are? You get to enjoy a nice warm meal, why not me? Besides, I've been craving some meat for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to eat something tasty!" Kim teased.*

Kason is an earnest, but overwhelmed paladin, blatantly faltering in his charge of leading his life-long dragon ward, Kim, towards the path of Good. Despite years of moralizing and preaching at the playful young dragoness, she has leaned into her predatory nature and wantonly consumes numerous sentient women across the lands of Mendes. Following along her parental paladin guardian, often invisible, Kim does as she pleases as Kason battles the forces of evil and tries to steer her back towards a humane path. Remember, the dragoness can turn invisible, but the prey inside her stomach cannot! Possible plot elements to include later in the story: Kason feels bad about Kim's prey, and tries to use healing magic and buffs to alleviate their discomfort, but only makes things worse. Kim uses good vs evil battle language as innuendo to goad the paladin into illicit love-making.

### *Smug Gnome Druid Fertilizes Forest With Amazons*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2658>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/hhnvnt.jpg)
{: .center}

>*The small gnome, garbed in a heap of stinking, recycled rags and old-animal skins, sauntered out to the center of the glen and awaited the approaching war-party. As the tall, muscular Amazonian shield-maidens approached with characteristic zeal, wantonly trampling his herbal gardens, the gnome smirked smugly to himself, realizing they were dooming themselves as the hulking sergeant of the female troop called out to the small druid "Foul little stink-worm! I have come to face you in single battle like a woman! Face me if you dare, or be cut down like the animal you are!" though her bellowing words were mighty, Shamus could already see an unsteady, sluggish tilt spreading across the well-armed squad, as the women began rubbing their increasingly sore, stiff muscles. A look of concern spread over the sergeant's face, as she called out "What foul devilry is---Hhyuurk!" her sentence was cut-off mid-word, as he jaw muscles seized and stiffened, the twelve or so women coming to an awkward halt as they simply froze in place, their impressive muscular bodies twitching and seizing as the paralytic plant venom kept them motionless. Several of the troop fell down, still frozen in awkward poses on the ground, as a gentle rustling in the tall glen grass could be heard, as something slithered nearby the incapacitated warrior women.*
>
>*Shamus strode up to the stilled sergeant, calmly saying as he stroked his matted, gray beard "You women from your 'mighty' civilization think you have grown beyond the power of nature, that your farms and walls and dams can thwart and tame the elements, that you have become the absolute masters of all you see, but this is a grave error in thought. We are all a part of nature, a part of the cycle of life, and you haughty despoilers will soon find out exactly where you women rank on this forest's food-chain." with his speech over, the small druid let out a loud hissing sound, eliciting a louder rustling from the surrounding brush. The last remaining mobile part of the paralyzed Amazonian warrior women, their eyes, all swiveled to the mighty sight of a rearing anaconda, much larger than any snake normally should be, as its long, bifurcated tongue flicked at the air, tasting the scent of the women's sweat and fear.*

A gnome druid renounces civilization and finds peace in the natural world, until a militant nation of Amazonian warrior women sees his forest as the perfect patch of land to exploit for their burgeoning war-machine. The druid desperately tries to fend off this advanced, superior foe, using guerilla warfare, the forest's might, and his hungry anaconda animal companion, which has defeated many burly harridans with its expansive stomach. Use Shamus's powers to call animals, enchanted plants, and other natural allies to defeat the invading forces of civilization.

>*My name is Bill Alger. I'm a human rookie architect from the big city, but I've been invited by the mayor of a new small town that was impressed by my work to help him plan the town's development. The town is named Palm Leaf and is located between two mountains and close to the beach.*
>
>*I'm really excited about arriving. I was happy to hear someone was interested in my work, I was starting to have trouble getting a job. Plus city life in the city has become repetitive and unfulfilling. Spending some time on a nearly private beach for a few months will be the perfect break. Then the light started to peer out of the darkness and the train had finally passed through the tunnel. Looking out the window again I saw the beautiful stretch of nature leading out towards the beach. From atop the hill, I can see a river flowing from the forest through the plains and out into the ocean. In the open area, there are a few buildings along a small road that must be the town. The train starts to slow as it approaches and I see the small platform that is the town's train station.*

Take on the role of Bill Alger an amateur architect the only human resident in the small town of Palm Leaf. Recently purchased from an elderly by Mayor Nook. He wants you to help him develop the town into a tourist destination.

### *Beasties and Swampy Cities - Guzzle*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2660>*
{: .center}

>*A cacophony of giant insects and otherworldly life echoed through dense clusters of cypress trees as the night wore on. Neon lights flickered dimly through the gloom, casting a jaundiced glow. Steam rose up from the murky canals that infested and overflowed through the city, giving the place a febrile atmosphere. The deep hum of industrial machinery and the chaotic clangor of revelry and rough-housing filled the air. Big black eyes stared up at the encroaching fogâthe eyes of a wandering opossum waif named Guzzle. Her fur was sooty, matted and filthy; she was a skinny creature, haggard and ragged, clad in a tattered sweater that hung loose about her shoulders. Hopping over a pile of broken bricks, she gazed blankly at the dim light of a leaning lamppost and clutched at the knife hidden beneath her sweater. "I'm 'ungry," the emaciated opossum muttered, licking her dry black lips. "Need to find somefin' to eat."*

Guzzle tries to survive in the harsh city of Gutterstain.

>*Soon, a boy riding his bicycle notices the dog.*
>
>*"Doggy!" the boy exclaims, stopping his bike in its tracks and approaching the dog by foot.*
>
>*He pets the dog and plays with it.*
>
>*By the time the dog finally had enough and decides to go elsewhere, the boy leaves his most favorite action figure for the dog to use as a chewing toy.*
>
>*Then the dog continues walking around the street.*

Prompt where a "magic" dog is for some reason treated like a king by anyone around it.

>*In fact, these shows where women are swallowed down screaming by the unique animals are often the most popular for spectators to watch. The cosmopolitan crowds are often fascinated, and even sickened, by the sight of hapless women being slowly dragged into the slimy maws of creatures capable of stuffing countless writhing female feeding slaves into their stretchy stomachs. Some of the zoo's predatory creatures are so tame, visitors are allowed to walk up and pet their bloated stomachs. Some enjoy to marvel at the sight, feeling, and sound of the poor girls writhing in their dominating predator's stomach, enduring a lengthy digestion process as zoo patrons gawk at their consumer's bloated bellies and line up for photos. A particularly skilled and experienced tour guide is leading a group of excited tourists along the most popular zoo attractions the facility has to offer, during feeding time for the animals.*

A capricious, callously operated zoo capitalizes on easy to acquire, but hard to care-for voracious alien beasts, by putting on grisly live-feeding shows for their morbid audience of high-paying spectators. A skilled tour-guide leads a gaggle of gawking tourists along to observe the zoo's infamous live animal feeding shows. The tour guide, Avril, is exposing the eager, nervous watchers to the various feasting styles of the zoo's bizarre animals, starting with the ever-popular gulp-lizard.

>*They really should have retreated from the woods but the young adventurers were a bit greedy and so sure of their ability to complete several quests in a row that they would be in for a quite eventful few weeks in these dank woods.*
>
>*When Linko came to Violet this morning announcing that he had accepted a quest in the pig woods, she could barely contain her excitement. Maybe it would be possible to finally realize her fantasy.*
>
>*Violet knows what fat pigs are really like. She imagines their three precious adventurer girls getting fucked and bred by them and how much cum they will spray out of those beastly penises. Violet loves these girls but she cant help it, Her pussy gets nice and wet when she thinks his sonÂ´s important childhood friends might end up becoming breeding cattle for fat pigs.*

An nice adventuring group is torn asunder by the fetishes of the heroes mother. She wishes to see their darling girls become a fat animals livestock. This variation focuses on the fat pigs of the pig wood.

>*From Piddler's back, the goblin wildling had delivered swift justice to many unsuspecting elven archers with his rusty dirk. Piddler could pad along so softly on his big furry paws, that even an elf's long ears often failed to detect the mounted beast prowling up from behind. Snignag had perfected the art of catching lone elves with Piddler, the dynamic duo sneaking up on, then startling their elf enemies during the crucial moments of ambush with a mighty howl and shrieking goblin war-cry. There was nothing the measly green goblin loved more, than laying haughty elven warrior low, and subjecting them to Piddler's more bestial inclinations, as well as Snignag's randy, wanton goblin sex-drive.*

A small, malformed green creature happens upon the abandoned runt of a ferocious canine predator species, and a life-long friendship is born. Snigsnag the goblin rides Piddler the dire wolf like a knight riding a mighty steed, and in Quixotic grandeur, hunts the elves that have mercilessly tried to exterminate his diminutive species for centuries. His wolf is more concerned with getting his knot pleasured, and his belly filled, than Snigsnag is obsessed with mocking and degrading whatever hapless elf he can get in his stubby-green clutches, or under Piddler's mighty, furry paws.

>*Greg was lost as to what to do next. Jumping back onto the bed, he glanced through the window, and there he saw his reflection superimposed on the bedroom view he had grown to tolerate. He looked like the quintessential short-haired, pointy-eared, stray dog with cream furâan appearance as noteworthy as he had been until yesterday. Behind him, a stiff tail wagged like a metronome. He had never fancied himself a âdog personââthe label made him groan; the irony even more soâbut he had to admit he would have petted him, were not for his predicament.*

One morning, as Greg Samil was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a mongrel.

>*Eventually, the college student reasoned that this man must simply be dangerously senile, before leading Matt to a back-room filled with security monitors, as the old man pushed in an old VHS taped and said "Look, just watch this and you'll understand." as the fuzzy tape footage played, and Matt observed a security recording play out. It featured Yancy heaving the gigantic octopus Matt had observed earlier, which gripped around the old man securely with all eight appendages as he teetered and tottered under its weight, before awkwardly chucking it into a nearby floor-pool. Yancy motioned for him to look at a door which opened straight to the pool, as a dark-skinned Asian woman strode in, immediately falling into the water below, with the giant octopus. Matt's heart started racing at what he saw, as he realized the footage looked genuine, as he watched the octopus wrap it's slimy tentacles over her thrashing body in the turbulent water. "Keep watching, darn thing's been debeaked apparently, so it puts on quite a show..." the old man mused, as Matt sat transfixed, watching the grizzly footage.*

Matt is a financially strapped college student that hears about a lucrative job opportunity in a college town that doesn't have much work to offer. The awkward freshman walks to the obscure location in his Sunday best, to try to land his first big job, only to be greeted by a huge, sprawling, dilapidated concrete compound, ominously titled 'Yancy Randall's Exotic Pets! (Tours by appointment only)'. Matt quickly discovers that the old man's shop is the end-of-the-line for a bio-engineering lab's many freakishly enlarged, woman-hungry mutant animals, as he is featured to a graphic depiction of what his new duties keeping the many pet animals 'fed' entails.

>
>*"Well..." Whitney cleared her throat. "The student council president said we can't let them find out about this. You see," she began gesturing, "when she was possessed, she said it made her feel ...strange," Whitney looked down and blushed. "It made her do... things. With her PokÃ©mon."*

>*"What kind of things?" Riley asked, feeling a hot flush sweep across his face.*
>
>*"...Let's just say none of the female students or council members feel comfortable handling this, and leave it at that."*

A young PokÃ©mon breeder encounters a supernatural presence causing students and their PokÃ©mon to act strangely.

>*All at once, the station's AI delivers a robotic warning: 'DANGER. THREAT ELEVATED TO RED: CRITICAL POWER FAILURE. POSSIBLE CULTISTS ACTIVITY. ALL SECURITY ARE PERMITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS. EMERGENCY SHUTTLE CALLED. AWAITING RESPONSE.' The fluorescent lights of the interrogation room flicker and dull as the station switches over to auxiliary power; I can hear faint screams in the distance. Communications go silent.*
>
>*I knew this shift was going to be a mess.*
>
>*My wannabe arresting officer nearly careens out of her chair, quivering in place, "M-My uncle said this would be an easy assignment! I'm going to die with a bunch of peasants, aren't I?" This kid isn't a badass in the slightest, let alone commanding officer material; I shake my shackles to make my presence known again.*
>
>*"Listen, uncuff me so we can get to the armory." This girl is a mess, but at present holds all the power; her keycard is almost like a skeleton key given she's a JCO. For a moment, I see her for what she really is: a scared little girl. I'm no action hero, but it would be pretty fucked up for me to just bolt on her, and again, I need her as much as she may need me if we wanna escape.*
>
>*"Fuck," a long sigh slips past my lips, "uncuff me and...I'll do my best to make sure we make it out of here alive."*
>
>*The cuffs unlock with a digital 'beep', "You're d-damn right you'll do your best! I-I'm a top priority!" Behind that authoritative bark is a panicky child; tearful eyes and a quivering pout prove that.*

Framed for a murder that you obviously didn't commit, a pencil-pushing Junior Command Officer LARPs as security personnel for your interrogation; when the station comes under threat her faÃ§ade is blown. Can you evacuate the station alive?

>*It was hard to tell whether minutes or hours that had passed, though I assumed the former when Ms. Nagoi released a short sigh. The HR lead rose, giving her stocking clad thighs a quick brushing. Something compelled me to remain seated as she wordlessly passed over the crushed beer cans and abandoned eating utensils; Akame's expression unaffectionate as as she reached the song selection terminal. Watching the passionless office lady spend so much time selecting a song was a slight mindfuck. Was she looking for something in particular? Or did she have no clue what to do?*
>
>*It seemed that the electronic catalogue of songs was nearing its end, until Akame's index finger settled upon some unseen number.*
>
>*The room's automatic lights dimmed as the petite woman took the stage, their rainbow incandescence replaced with a harsh shade of red; what song had she picked? I soon had my answer as a fiendish guitar rift penetrated the silence and nearly spooked me senseless. Akame's head bobbed to the devilish trills, slow at first, then increasingly savage as if possessed by the spirit of 'Metal'.*

The feared Akame Nagoi is often viewed as a mute enforcer of corporate policy, quick to terminate employees as her responsibility of senior HR staff dictates. As the night progresses at a mandatory karaoke night, you alone witness Akame reveal her true colors.

>*"You know," Seraph mused, her silvery eyes settling upon mine, "you should really relax more often." We paused at the copying room before entering, my witchy companion pressing the creases of her dark, pencil dress. "It's good for you."*
>
>*"'Relax'," I guffawed, "Please enlighten me, Seraph, what constitutes 'relaxation' in this office?"*
>
>*She laughed. "I'm just saying, you're not getting any younger, and you don't look like you've been sleeping well lately."*
>
>*"Oh, I sleep fine," I lied.*
>
>*Upper-management had magically sealed me inside of the office a few years back; a handful supervisors complaining that I wasn't there to provide a fresh shot of spunk to their morning cup of joe. Escape was impossible, and I'd consented to being their on-demand fucktoy with drab resignation, "Just can't get enough of my work, I guess."*

Hired on as a mailroom associate, the witches of SalemSales see you as their perfect little cum-bag. What's a guy to do but resign himself to his fate? Perhaps the opportunity to escape may arise? Probably not.

>*"Did you buy these," Cordelia inquired, a wary eyebrow raised, "because I was quite clear with the department's 'office planning' committee concerning office-kitchen etiquette, Iâ"*
>
>*"They're donuts, Cordelia." My eyes were half-open, a thermos of coffee glued to my lips; I had no time for the dark elf's peculiarities and reached around to retrieve a syrupy, golden bun.*
>
>*My lack of outrage to her plight, or apologetic groveling at minimum, made the neurotic gal nearly pop a gasket, "My point exactly! Your world's artificially-sweetened confectionaries are - vile, insidious creations! My superior metabolism cannot adequately digest these alchemical abominations!" A small piece of sugary pastry fell from Cordelia's lips as she ranted on about their nutritional content.*
>
>*"Wait, are you eating one?" I asked incredulously, tilting my head to the side.*
>
>*Exposed, wide-eyed, mouth agape, Cordelia shrieked, "What? N-No, I am not!"*

Long after the merging of our worlds, Dark Elf Cordelia and I come to a peculiar crossroads as her addiction to sugary sweets compels her to make a most scandalous proposition.

### *Raika's After Hours Confession*

>*"So, uh, are you gonna come out with me tonight?" I asked, hoping to get her mind off whatever it was.*
>
>*"I'm heading home after I get my stuff; maybe later, dude." It was as if every word was some effort to her, oozing angst.*
>
>*My gut churned, "You're not going to tell me why?"*
>
>*She shook her head, "No, I've had my fill." We'd arrived at her desk. Lo and behold, her personals were scattered across its top; the air hung thick with one-sided tension. Even as I looked to her eyes to find some inkling of vulnerability, Raika averted her gaze.*
>
>*"Ok, cool. Well, see ya tomorrow then." My tone was curt, I could feel myself getting angry. She might be upset, but I couldn't let this go unchallenged.*
>
>*"Maybe."*
>
>*There was a long pause. Even as Raika held her door keys, neither of us budged. In my peripheral vision, I watched her chest rise and fall with each breath. Then, finally, she turned to me, the weight of her stare heavy. Her lips parted slightly, she stared down at me, eyes pleading.*
>
>*She looked frozen, so I started with an awkward affirmation, "You can tell me anything, you know. So if something is bothering youâ"*
>
>*"Can I?" she cut in, interrupting me. The last thing I expected was such sharpness from an easygoing friend, but I was willing to give her space to vent. With a sigh, she said, "You don't even see me, do you? After all this time." Raika's voice was a whisper, as if she was talking through me; she shook her head in shameful disbelief.*

The emotions of a one-sided infatuation explode to the surface after a corporate softball tourny, your tomboy BFF and officemate opening herself to you in ways never before imagined.

>*Authority and submission went a long way between us, so the message was immediately received. Maddy nuzzled her ebony locks into my neckline as we hugged to seal her apology, "Ok, 'Daddy', I won't do it again." The glaring size difference between us was apparent when we embraced; a whiff of Maddy's natural smell exciting the part of me I generally kept subdued in public.*
>
>*For 2 years, I'd trained Madeline to masquerade as my daughter, a deep rooted obedience ingrained into her psyche by rigorous Pavlovian conditioning. "Can I fix it so you aren't upset?" Such an innocent question laced with deviant implication.*
>
>*Just bringing my little plaything to work had been a burst of exhilaration, the danger of being outed only strengthening my lust; why did voyeurism excite me so? I looked around to make sure no one was lingering in the immediate vicinity of my desk; it was clear.*
>
>*"I'm not upset, silly goose, but you can help me." Maddy's silken locks felt amazing as I massaged the dark crown of her hair, scratching at the little girl's scalp to milk a childish coo. We were of one mind, my little sweetheart and I, a primal heat filling her cheeks under my ministrations.*

Under the cover of 'Bring Your Child to Work Day', your lovely little loli accompanies you to the office for some down and dirty voyeurism. How many lewd hijinks can you get into before getting caught?!

>*At first it felt odd to repeatedly touch, massage and feel up Rochelle's feet and lower legs, but you'd soon developed a taste for it. Hell, you even looked forward to overtime when Rochelle was around. Even just the sight of Rochelle walking past you could send memories of the feel of her hot and soaked feet, the gentle, feminine smell of her sweat to your brain. The resulting erections made you consider jerking off in the office restrooms, but you avoided doing that, for now.*

>*"Come on in, not so timid, I don't bite! Take a seat, John... I can call you John, right?" he asks, that wide smile never leaving his face.*
>
>*Unsure in general, but sure of my station beneath him, I nod and give him a curt answer of "Of course, Mr. Adams.".*
>
>*The smile on his face is replaced by a look of mock disappointment. "Oh, John, you don't need to be so formal. Just call me Steve, we're all part of one big family here at GeneroCorp! Though we're not related by blood, so we can love each other all we want, too..." he says, sexual tension already building between us just from his tone of voice and phrasing. Then, with one swift movement of his hand under his desk, the lamps in the room begin to dim and the candlelight starts taking over the lighting. It's becoming more and more clear just what is going on here, and it seems like my boss is taking some sort of pleasure in making me squirm here, knowing full well that I can't disagree with anything without putting my job in jeopardy.*
>
>*With timidity audible in my voice, I just reply "Alright, M... um, Steve.", then look away. Right now, I'm out of my depth in every wayâI had no idea he would be this blatant in hitting on me. But at the same time... he's cute. That smile of his seems so sincere, like he's not doing this just because he gets off on the power dynamic of bossing around his subordinates, but is actually into me in a personal way. And there's a part of me that is falling for it. Something about his immaculate feminine appearance is just so alluring that I can't help but start feeling turned on by it.*

It's been a few weeks since the owner's son has been installed as your new boss. While he has a few eccentric behaviors, none is more noticeable than his flamboyant behavior and his penchant for wearing women's clothing. If only he didn't look so god damn cute doing it, you might just be able to ignore it. Making matters worse, he's called you into his office after hours for a one-on-one performance review...

### *A Boring Job*

>*"Good morning," I greet them as I enter the office, sitting down at my tiny desk in one corner of the room. It's the only desk without a PC on it as well, which is entirely inappropriate, considering that they hired me as a programmer. 'Don't worry, we'll build you one tomorrow,' is what Jake set on my first day, but now it's been a week and I still don't have a way to actually work on any code. I brought my own laptop to work today though. Up to now, I used to just awkwardly sit in the corner, all dolled up as required by my personal dress code and twiddling my thumbs while the guys glance over now and then and stare at my tits for a while.*

You get hired as the only female employee to do programming at a small startup, but all you get is a bunch of brogrammers ordering you around, having you fetch coffee and making sexist comments. At least the pay is good.

>*"Stay calm, [Anon], you'll get through this day," you tell yourself as you inspected yourself in your office's bathroom mirror. A frown forced itself upon your lips as you kept staring, feeling your confidence falter at the sight of how much your eyes were trembling, giving away your anxiety. Today would be one of the most stressful days of your career. Your supervisor volunteered you to become a project lead a few weeks ago, and today you were asked to give your first report on the project's progress. It was the first time ever you would do such a thing.*
>
>*The week leading up to your report could not have gone worse, sadly. Some setbacks occurred, sure. But worst of all a new nickname for you spread around the office like wildfire.*

Be an (androgynous) gay, do crimes. But only if it's professional misconduct in the office.

>
>*"Are you okay?!" you jump from your chair and rush toward her.*
>
>*"Eh? What happened?" she tries to get back up, but the rubble prevents her from doing so.*
>
>*As you look closer, it seems the shelf did not fall on her directly but wedged itself around her body. Jess herself is unharmed but immobilized by the tangle of furniture in this embarrassing position.*
>
>*"I'll get you out of there, just wait." you grab your phone and start taking pictures of that lovely butt sticking helplessly from the mess.*
>
>*"What are you doing?" you hear her voice.*
>
>*"I need to make sure it doesn't collapse farther, so just..." you are stalling for time when you notice that she looks at you through the cracks in the wooden jumble.*
>
>*"I, emm..."*

>
>*"What!? How does someoneâan office worker not have a phone in this day and age!?" I say dumbfounded. "What do you even carry in that purse of yours?"*

>
>*Then, you gently lay her petite body on the couch.*
>
>*"Onii... chan?" she looks at you, surprised.*
>
>*You reach out and take her tiny feet in your palms. They are so small that you can easily wrap your hands around them.*
>
>*"You feel pretty tense here. Are your shoes comfortable?" you say as you start giving her a foot massage.*
>
>*"They are fine..." Ruka starts to fidget "Oniichan, this tickles."*
>
>*"Do you dislike it?" you ask, continuing to rub her delicate soles with your thumbs.*
>
>*"Hi-hi-hi... stop, oniichan!" the girl twists on the couch as you knead her little feet.*
>
>*"What? Don't act like a child, that's just a foot massage." you proceed to service her, but then notice something "Ooh, what do we have here?"*

>*He picked it up, giving it a quick glance. It seemed to be a contract of employment, detailing the terms of a new position within her company. His eyes scanned over the page once more, noting that he was to work as an administrative assistant. A number of clauses detailed compensation and responsibilities, but there was nothing that stood out as particularly unusual. Nothing jumped out at him to indicate that something was wrong with it. In fact, it all seemed perfectly legitimate and just.*
>
>*"Due to the ambiguity of your soul, your employer has decided to employ your services for divine rehabilitationâ¦" it stated plainly, ending with a line that read: "If any discrepancies arise between these terms and your actual performance in your role, your fate will be sealed."*
>
>*âAnd who is it who decides my fate?â he asked, turning a critical eye upon her face. "Or is this simply some sort of joke?â*
>
>*âAll in due time,â she answered cryptically. âJust know that you have been hired for this task based on your past failures, impeccable work ethic, and high tolerance for pain.â*
>
>*He paused for a moment, weighing the situation. It was either remain left in the dark without a clue of who he was, or oblige and simply hope the woman would eventually reveal some truth. It should have been obvious which choice to make. He picked up the pen and signed the bottom line, using the only moniker he could think of at the moment: âNumber 32.â*

You make sure to step to the side as you open the door, ensuring the goblin that gets the "red stain" treatment on the wall behind you doesn't sully your clothes. Upon entering you find the former succubus empress of the underworks chugging down a cup of 'vitality-enriched' espresso in seductive office wear that shows off her red body's curves in all the right places. Her blonde hair seems a bit more "burnt by hellfire" than usual, her cocytus-blue eyes are strained, and she's just finished crumpling the drink in her hand and tossing it into the pile of identical drinks behind her before addressing you in a sarcastic tone. "Oh hellooooo your evilness. I'm oh soooo honored you could make it 15 minutes late to the budget meeting on virgin blood tithes. Need I remind you we have a board room meeting with the Telesian mafia in an hour on protection racket rates? I don't know what I hate more, that I lost to you at Veningrad, or that you put me in charge of this mess of a world government while you are off playing tyrant with Dranoch the Glacial Lich."*

Being the evil overlord requires a lot of paperwork, good thing you have a succubus secretary to sort it (among other things) all out for you.

You watched Jackie leave without turning back to face you and felt an odd chill down your spine. "So that's why we keep running into each other so often, huh?" you heard Lena ask. She must've walked by as you were talking with Jackie.*

>*"So, why don't we get started on what you so desperately want to do to me?", Lena said, catching you completely off guard.*

Idle chatter over a watercooler shouldn't devolve into talking about lewd things involving superiors, buddy. Reap what you have sown, even if you don't deserve it.

>*If now you can be with her, all this pain was worth it.*

>*Looking around the room, you see it's some kind of cavern. On the ground, beneath the stone walls, corpses of people lie, in the pools of their own blood, their hands and feet are tied together.*

>*My first destination is my own place. As I step inside, the first thing I do is grab a key off the tableâthe key to Taylor's place. A month or so back, I asked him if he could give me a spare key to his place just in case something happens, and he did give me one. So far, I've had no reason to use it, but I think tonight will be the first time. The next thing I consider is getting out of this costume and changing into some normal clothes, but on second thought, I decide to keep this getup on. Maybe I can convince Taylor that we can have our own private Halloween party together, just the two of us.*

Two friends, an unspoken crush, and a succubus costume. This Halloween night, they come together and find out just how far they are willing to go.

>*You make your way over to your bathroom, flicking on the light and running the taps. As you lather away the product of your polished prose from your fingers, you glance upwards to examine yourself in the bathroom mirror. Your own face greets you, looking the same as it always has. You turn your face this way and that; is that another wrinkle? If you were still in the mood to dress up for Halloween, you might consider going as the concept of inexorably marching time. That's a terror tried and true, but how would that costume even work? That's what you have on your mind when you dry your hands, flick the light off, and begin to slip through the bathroom door. You barely even register what the corner of your eye catches as you turn away; if not for the colossal shot of adrenaline your sympathetic nervous system just slammed into your veins, you might've missed it entirely.*
>
>*A burning pit shooting up your middle, as if falling from a great height; your mind is already racing with rationalizations. It's late, you're tired, what you just saw can't possibly be real. Just a trick of the light. But you could've sworn that as you yourself turned away....*
>
>*...your reflection didn't.*

On a quiet All Hallows' Eve, (You) catch a glimpse of something odd about your reflection.

>*Trembling, I ask the curious woman, "Who are you, and what are you doing in my room?"*
>
>*In an almost ethereal manner, she moans out a response, "What do you mean, love? You know who I am, let me remind you..."*
>
>*Before I get the chance to even think about what I've just heard, she tries to grab my shoulder, but her hand passes through just like smoke, leaving a sticky spot of ectoplasm on my shirt. What's going on? My heart starts racing, I try to keep calm by taking deep breaths, backing up onto my bed, away from the lady. It suddenly clues in though, she isn't alive, is she?*
>
>*"What's wrong?" The ghost asks, her ghastly voice echoing through the room, "Don't you want to show me how much you love me, it's our honeymoon after all..."*

What happens when a woman dies on her honeymoon? Hey, not all poltergeists are angry, some want a bit more than that.

>*You double over, hand clutched to your breast, but keep your eyes aligned with hers. Trying, and failing, to keep your voice even, you say, "I must admit to having enjoyed being your professor, far too much so in fact. It's caused me to overstay my welcome, as it were."*
>
>*"I don't understand. Do you need a doctor?"*
>
>*"No," you insist, still straining to keep your tone dissonantly cheery. "There's nothing that lot could do for one in my condition in any case. I have beenâ¦ self-reliant for quite some time."*
>
>*She gasps as you feel the burning in your eyes coming to a head, vessels bursting, a trickle of blood streaking down your gaunt face. The pain is palpable now, impossible to suppress. The moment is near, so you suppose it's time to end the charade and make plain the way of things.*

>
>*Just wished to hear your reply, Cat. It is entertaining to hear you dance around the predicament of your current existence as some extra arcane horsepower for my AI.*
>
>*\>\>Oh, I see. I hope I bring you pleasure, Master. I need to bring you pleasure.*
>
>*Oh, absolutely. I still remember the shock on your face when I finished the ritual to alter your physical shape into pure data. Man, you were such a haughty bitch back then, remember?*

>*Red's and Rozelle's pristine bare feet brushed against the cold and murky wood of the staircase leading up to the front door while Dominica floated in the midnight void slightly behind them. The vampire princess fought every impulse in her tiny body to run away, balled her slender, pale fingers into a fist, and carefully knocked on the front door.*
>
>*Immediately, as if he had been waiting on the other side, the door flew open and the neighborhood freak, Anon stood there. The tall, overweight and bespectacled nerd towered over the three monster girls. He grinned maniacally.*
>
>*"Uoooohhh! Spooky little loli girls! Wholesome hecking spooky chungus! Much seasonal, much topical!" Anon squealed with joy as he let his hungry gaze wander over the three little girls on his porch.*
>
>*"Umm... m-mister... the umm... candy?" Red clutched her basket with two hands and held it up to Anon. She had shut her eyes, she dared not look at him.*
>
>*"Yeah, like, give us candy, mister! Pacha pacha!" Dominica agreed while levitating her filled to the brim with candy basket up and down in the air in front of Anon for emphasis.*
>
>*Anon's protruding jowls shook as a laugh erupted from his sizeable belly. "Of course! Mochiron desu! Le candy for le wholesome cute and funny little nightmare waifus. Cutie force must protecc, am I right?! Le candy's inside Anon's funhouse!"*
>
>*The three girls exchanged nervous glances while Anon gestured for them to enter his spooky mansion. Eventually, Rozelle nodded, feigning confidence while she squeezed past the fat man as he ushered her inside. Her two friends followed. Red looked back over her shoulder at the moonlit street one final time before Anon closed the door behind her. An almost inaudible growl erupted from deep within her. Red had a bad feeling about this...*

'tis the season after all.

>*The serval looked back at the pathetic looking monochromatic dog who was trembling with fear and humiliation. "I'm not going to hurt you," she said reassuringly. "Just get over here."*
>
>*Cathy hesitated, then slowly inched forward until she could feel the cold air from outside blowing against her body. She let out an involuntary whimper when she felt the coolness of the wind ruffle through her fur and caress her nipples. It tickled her sensitive ears and made her tail tuck between her legs involuntarily. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stared down at the floor, waiting for whatever would happen next.*
>
>*"Cat," Jada whispered softly as Cathy continued to stare at the ground. "Do you know why I'm making you do this?"*
>
>*Cathy's gaze flickered to her roommate, her penitence apparent. "Jad, I'm really sâ"*
>
>*"Shhh," Jada interrupted, pressing a finger against the border collie's snout. "I'm not mad anymore. I know it was just a mistake, and I've had a bit of time to get over it, but I think you still need some punishment before we go back to normal, and I figured Halloween was the perfect opportunity for it. Agreed?"*
>
>*"Y-yeah..." Cathy stammered, unsure what exactly Jada wanted from her or if she even knew herself.*
>
>*"Good," the serval purred, letting out a soft sigh that caused the border collie to shiver. "Now let's get your 'costume' on. You're gonna be my little puppy tonight."*

A serval decides on her roommate's costume for Halloween.

>
>*"These cookies taste kinda funny..." you say as your vision starts to blur and your feel your surroundings are a mile away.*
>
>*"That just means it's working. How lucky am I to find a cute boy like you here on Halloween?" you faintly hear before you fall limply back onto the couch and black out.*

You came to the wrong neighborhood.

A boy goes trick or treating alone and ends up at a strange house with a lady dressed in black leather and a witch hat. He thinks it's treat time and ends up getting drugged and tricked instead.

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2387>*
{: .center}

>*The asinine pecking order of Broad River High meant that anthro girls like her got pushed around and bullied by the human kids. Wendy, the arbiter of her suffering, was the top dog at this dump, and her hatred for anthrosâespecially girls like Jamieâmeant that this discrimination was enforced; and all Jamie could do was sit still and take it. The teachers wouldn't do anythingâWendy was too smart to be caught red-handedâand the other anthro kids hated the idea of forming a united front, saying it was "too much hassle" and "their futures were at stake". Well, what did they know? How could they experience routine humiliation for uncontrollable truths? As far as Jamie was concerned, so long as this carried on, she had no future. She had to do something about it.*

> *After a few days of her stalking you and you trying your best to talk to her so that she stops you decide that enough is enough.*
>
> *Today she is following you around from a distance like always.*
>
> *You let out an annoyed sigh and walk up to her.*
>
> *"FINE! IF YOU WANT TO STALK ME SO MUCH, HOW ABOUT WE JUST START DATING, HUH!? WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STOP!?" You shout with annoyance.*

>*Mind you, the news of my magical heritage seemed like an elaborate joke...until she callously transferred me from my very much 'human' school and shipped me off to this nightmarish parody of 'Monster High'. Had she lost her mind? Perhaps I was losing mine.*
>
>*"Well," Ms. Bilal shuffled some files to the side with relative disinterest, "you'll need to shadow someone on your first week."*
>
>*St. Nosferatu was relatively indiscernible from any other middle to upper-class high school, bar the ghoulish student body it hosted; from lycanthropes to manticores and everything slimy, scaly and even alluring in between.*
>
>*I tried to make the most of a poor situation and approach the opportunity with a scrap of optimism, "Sounds alright with me, I guess, a guy to follow around would beâ"*
>
>*A chuckle from my newly appointed school counselor, "Sweetie, half of these boys would tear you apart, trust me." She paused as if scheming some cruel prank while I mulled over the torrid implications of the previous statement. "No, you'll need a girl to show you around," with that she sized me up like a slab of meat before faintly smirking, "I know just the clique."*
>
>*'Clique'?*

*Due to an 'unfortunate' loophole, you've been admitted to a high school that has traditionally only allowed monsters to enroll. To make matters worse, a trio of a spooky hotties have made it their mission to torment you, endlessly.*

>*Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed two things: that Harper had immediately pulled her phone out and begun idly flicking through it, and that as she had lay down, her skirt had slid down her leg to bunch around her hip, exposing a scandalous spread of her smooth caramel thigh. My pulse began to race, as much with excitement as with fear. I wanted to look away, to turn back to my workâbut I couldn't. That fleeting glimpse of Harper's tanned flesh had taken a strange hold over me, one that gripped my heart with an icy hand even as it beckoned me closer with the other. Slowly, trying to make as little motion and noise as possible, I turned to look at herâbracing myself all the while, expecting her to look up from her phone and catch me staring at any moment.*
>
>*"So what do we do first, loser?" she suddenly spoke up.*

A student is assigned to work a school project with his bully.

>*Annah had never back down from a fight before and I heard whispers about us during the entire rest of the class about how we've been hanging out after school. Now not only did my mother think we were dating, but everyone at school as well. It was humiliating enough that people thought I was dating the person I hated the most, but the worst part was I couldn't stop thinking about her.*

A fiery violent girl becomes overly attached to an icy calm guy. Opposites attract, but also get in a lot of fights too.

>*The room in front of me was just your average storage room, fairly empty apart from one table. But it was what was on that table that disturbed me. Laying there, bound and gagged, was one of the two jocks that abused me the night before.*
>
>*"See... I told you I wouldn't leave you alone for too long. And look who I brought! Your friend from last night!" Gavin said, a wicked smile slowly forming on his face. "You remember him, right?" The first thing I noticed was the look of terror on the jock's face. The second thing... was his erection. I couldn't believe itâwas he seriously getting turned on by this? It didn't take Gavin long to notice either, and he started laughing. "Oh, this is rich! The bully that loves making fun of us by calling us gay gets hard from being tied up by girly boys. What a twist... he's a masochist. Y'know... he looks kinda cute like this, all tied up and vulnerable."*
>
>*All the while, all I could do was stare. The sight in front of me was so confusing... and yet so alluring. I could feel my breathing quickening just looking at him, the one that hurt me, now tied up and defenseless. I wanted to have my way with him, to do to him what he did to me. Because he deserved to be punished. Gavin noticed my increasing tension and then decided to amp them up even further. He simply walked over to the jock, gently caressing his cheek with a smile. "Now, you'll be a good boy, right? Because if you aren't a good boy, I might have to call Victoria. And you don't want that, right?" he said softly.*
>
>*Vague disagreeing moans were all that managed to come through the jock's gag as he frantically shook his head. Gavin then walked over to my side, whispered "He's all yours... bully him good." into my ear and left the room. And so then there was silence. There was just me and the tied up and gagged jock in the room. Nobody else to see... nobody else to hear.*

Being a girly guy makes you a frequent target of bullying, especially if you're a new guy. But when another girly guy (and his huge enforcer girl) takes you under his wing, you find yourself on the other side. But for some reason, it's not just revenge that's on your mind...

>
>*"I'll bet your family doesn't feed you properly, either." Dolly giggled. "They probably give you scraps like old bones and dead mice."*
>
>*Emly looked away from Dolly. "My mum feeds me well. We have lots of nice food to eat."*
>
>*Dolly snorted loudly out of her thick snout. "You look half starved to me. I'm surprised you can walk straight. You should be ashamed of yourself, being such a skinny thing."*
>
>*Emly stopped walking. "What do you mean? I'm not thin at all. My body is perfectly proportionate. What are you staring at anyway?"*
>
>*Dolly blinked rapidly, as if she hadn't heard what Emlyn had said. She took a few steps closer to Emlyn. "Your coat is really shabby looking, Emly. It's torn and frayed. And you smell funnyâlike something died in your coat. Did someone die in your coat?"*
>
>*Emly backed away nervously. "No, I've never seen anyone dead before. Why would you say that?"*
>
>*Dolly grinned wickedly. "Because you stink! Your fur stinks, it's disgusting!"*
>
>*The other animals nearby turned to stare at the two girls. Wattle the weasel whispered something to Titch the rat, who ran over to join Dolly. The weasel followed after her.*
>
>*Titch smiled at Emly. "It's true, isn't it? You stink. Let's see how bad it is."*
>
>*Wattle nodded her head vigorously in agreement with Titch. "Yes, she does stink. Let's get rid of those dirty clothes of hers!"*

>*Today, another feeding was scheduled for Flora, Megan regarded with jittery and excited feelings she couldn't quite place. Megan drove to the botany wing of the research facility, where Flora was kept, as she absent-mindedly thumbed through her phone across a list of interns, trying to decide on the best woman to feed to the hungry Alraune. She decided on a tall blonde intern named Katie, who looked like a pretty good choice to satisfy the hungry plant woman. Katie had long flowing blonde hair and an athletic build, and appeared to be quite attractive to Megan. Megan read that Katie had tested for a rather low IQ, so Megan reasoned it wouldn't be much of a loss if the big woman ended up as plant fertilizer.*

In this voracious story, a conflicted but professional female researcher named Megan Holmes is spearheading research on the development and life-cycles of many exotic creatures, specifically a predatory plant-girl placed under her care, named Flora. Embark on a journey of female debasement as Megan tends to Flora's needs like a skilled, but detached gardener, until the once dispassionate scientist reveals the increasingly lewd and debauched feedings are beginning to awaken something hidden deep inside her.

>*Alma is the head of HR for a successful international company known as HCC. She is a professional business woman, but her status as a large blue dragon has earned her a well-known reputation in the company. HCC hires many fresh, motivated female interns straight from college to work in their offices, but the performance of these trainee-employees is often lacking. Alma takes a hands-on approach to employee management, she helps motivate the workforce by swallowing the under-performing women who work at HCC, whole and alive, utilizing her impressive swallowing and digestion capacities as a twenty-foot long dragon.*

Alma is a professional in charge of keeping the company of HCC's workforce lean and mean. The female dragon is notorious for her unorthodox but effective motivational strategies- which often boil down to consuming under-performing employees from the company's diverse workforce whole and alive, something which has earned the blue-scaled dragoness a much feared reputation.

>*"You're insane," I said, gritting my teeth. "I'll tell the headmaster about this slander, and I'll see you expelled."*
>
>*Celine knelt before me. The hem of her skirt slipped up a fraction, and even through my anger I hated myself for noticing the pale strip of flesh it revealed: the creamy skin of her thigh. Her eyes were unreadable as they stared into mine. "Unfortunately for you," she said softly, "society changed while you were practicing at being a recluse. Your name does not hold the weight it once did. The House of Sarre has already fallen."*
>
>*Her words struck with a terrible force. She spoke them so bluntly, they rung with the weight of truth. As the knowledge seeped into my brain, I stared at her, eyes wide. When I spoke, my voice was hardly above a whisper. "What? How?"*
>
>*Celine reached out, her fingertips cool against my cheek. She leaned in, lips brushing my ear. Her breath was warm, and smelled of flowers. "My family made a similar deal. The fate of the Falaises is tied to the inverse of the Sarres. You see, [Anon], we are bound together. To secure my future, I need to destroy yours."*

Life has been hard for you ever since Celine Falaise arrived at the Academy. Ostracized by those you once called friends, you now spend your time alone. One night, Celine Falaise corners you into a fateful confrontation...

>*The coach nodded to herself, and got the girls in the bus to step outside, which was difficult owing to the fantastical beast intently watching them from outside. Several of the volleyball athletes tried to film the mythological Sphinx, but they all found their phones lacked power and reception, mysteriously. Sophie waited until all the anxious, excited, and slightly scared women gathered with Lacy and Marge in front of Sophie, who appraised them happily as they assembled before her. The Sphinx then addressed the group: "Okay ladies, I'm sure you're all filled with questions right now, so I'll do my best to explain what's about to happen. I'm a Sphinx, and I enjoy asking people riddles. Guess my riddle correctly, and I'll help you leave, get it wrong though and well... We'll get to that part. Are you all following me so far?"*

Cats are notorious for enjoying to cruelly play with their food before eating it, and the ancient mythological sphinx is of no exception. Some of her riddles are a bit more well-thought out than others though, and the sly mythological lion-beast keeps a reserve of obtuse and unanswerable riddles in special reserve for a particularly sumptuous feast of tender female mortal flesh. A jaunty bus full of ill-advised female volley-ball stars have unknowingly landed themselves on the cross hairs of this ageless magical predator of the Egyptian deserts and Greek isles.

### *Hey Mom, Watch This*

>*No one else in your life was ever vocally homophobic, but your mother... when you were growing up, she couldn't let a sighting or mention of a gay couple pass by without muttering something hateful under her breath. In middle school, when you wanted to get your hair cut in the popular style of the time, she said no, that it looked "faggy."*
>
>*And now Eric, who is only a couple years older, has seduced your mom. But he didn't seduce her because he wanted to have sex with her. Far from it. Eric is gay, in fact. Eric seduced her, convinced her he was into bondage, and tied her to her bed. And now, the door has opened and it's time for you to enter the room. It's time for your homophobic mother to spend the next three or more hours watching her son absolutely worship the big, hard, magnificent cock of someone he loves.*

Your conservative mother made you really uncomfortable with your sexuality growing up. Now it's time for her to become really comfortable with it, since she's tied up and about to watch you suck and fuck like the bisexual boyslut you are.

>*"Oi! Who the hell are you!" Sakura rose from her seat again and made a loud BANG! as she slammed her fists against the desk. This pervert freak just begged to have his ass kicked!*
>
>*The creepy foreigner placed some small device on top of the teacher's desk and then sat down next to it. He smiled at her. If Sakura was not so supremely confident in her ability to beat this scrawny old guy up, she'd perhaps feel scared.*
>
>*âI'm your Guidance Counselor, Sakura. Sit down, calm down and listen to me." His Japanese was terrible but his voice was deep and comforting. The small device next to the man seemed to hum along with every word as he spoke. The humming gave his words gravitas.*
>
>*The no longer furious Japanese girl immediately sat down and waited for the man to continue speaking. "How could she not know that he was her Guidance Counselor?!" Sakura admonished herself for being so stupid, to forget something like that. She still felt really weirded out about his chosen attire but she remained calm, waiting for the man to continue speaking. She needed to listen to her Guidance Counselor.*
>
>*âMan, considering everything I've heard about you, I expected you to be some kind of female ogre or something. But you're like, really cute!â Sakura's Guidance Counselor said in his deep voice. He seemed to consider something for a moment before he continued. âHey, you do a lot of compensated dating with older men! You're basically a whore, isn't that right?â*
>
>*Sakura felt light-headed, it was as though her world was spinning for just moment. Perhaps, the humming from the device next to her Guidance Counselor grew more intense. Then, she nodded in agreement to his question. Although she had no memories of ever doing compensated dating or prostituting herself, there was not a shred of doubt in her mind that what her Guidance Counselor had just said about her was true. She did constantly go on compensated dates with old guys, and was basically a whore.*

A female bully receives some proper guidance from a concerned older gentleman with a mind control device.

>*Her hand slapped my fat belly, "Look at this, you're like a fucking pig." She said disgustedly, poking my stomach with her finger. "Like a big fat pig," she mocked. Again, I remained silent. She stepped forward, placing herself inches from my nose. "What's your name?" She asked, looking down into my eyes.*

>*"No, no, I don't want to know...I'll just called you pig." She cruelly chortled with a couple light slaps on my face. I didn't flinch. She grabbed my head, pulling my face to hers, "Pig." She repeated. I was silent.*

>*Liyi was discovering that she could do whatever she wanted to me, insult me, use me, berate me, and I wouldn't respond. She seemed to like that. My silence and lack of reaction to her taunts and abuse had become her entertainment.*

A gym shark decides to spend her night picking on the local fat bastard, (You). She can be dominate or you can awaken your inner mind breaking talent.

>*"I just don't know what to do, Phil. Do you have any ideas?" he finally asks, looking at me with an expression that looks utterly lost.*
>
>*Of course, I know immediately what my answer is. "You've got to dump her, man. It's not healthy to stick around with her. She'll probably ruin you if you keep trying to keep up with her." I reply before refilling his glass with some more liquor.*
>
>*"But how? I can't just tell her we're finished... I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that." he says, worry evident in his voice. That much is rightâJames is too much of a pushover. He was raised to always be his best, but never got to the point where he realized people can abuse that kindness.*
>
>*"Well, I've got to admit, I'm not sure myself. But you know what? Just stay over tonight. We can talk about good old times, have some more drinks, and I bet we'll come up with something." I suggest with a smile.*
>
>*James takes a few moments to think about it, but eventually he simply nods his head. I'm very glad he accepted, because I'm certain that a night together with his best friend is exactly what he needs. And so, our night of memories and alcohol begins. We take trips down memory lane and take some more shots of liquor, and it seems that it's working, as James definitely seems to be feeling better. But all the while, I'm still thinking about how he could break up with his abusive girlfriend. And while it might be because I'm getting drunk, I suddenly have an idea that I think could work.*
>
>*"Hey, James... you wanna really piss off your soon to be ex-girlfriend?" I ask him.*
>
>*I thought that he might have some trepidation about this whole thing, but it seems that the alcohol is getting to him as well, so he replies "Yeah, man, let me hear it.".*

One day, your best friend sends you an ominous text message that he needs to come over and that it's important. An hour and a drink or two later, it becomes clear that his girlfriend has been abusive to him, and he feels like he has to break up with her, but doesn't know how. And it might just be the alcohol, but you think you have a great idea that ends up with him being together with someone that really cares about him...

>*Everything was silent in my apartment for a moment. Then, I turned, calling out sternly, "Evie!" There was a flutter of wings, and a scrambling from deeper into my apartment as Evie ran to answer me. After a moment, she ran in from the kitchen, the feathers of her wings all a-fluff, a distinct smugness to her demeanor.*
>
>*"Hello master! Did the mean human girl go away now?" she chirped cheerily, her arms folded behind her back as she looked up at me.*
>
>*I crossed my arms over my chest, glaring down at her sternly. "Sierra was my girlfriend, Evie, and she deserved to be treated with respect, not terrorized like that. Why do you always do this to my girlfriends?" I scolded.*
>
>*"Hm? What are you talking about, master?" she asked, putting on an air of innocent confusion.*
>
>*"You tear up their clothes, break their things, and harass them every time they come to visit! Five of my girlfriends have broken up with me because of you, Evie! Five!" I pointed accusingly at her.*
>
>*Evie scowled, her wings fluffing up a bit. "Stupid human girls shouldn't be with master! Master should be with Evie, not stupid humans!" she yelled, stomping her little foot angrily and pouting.*

Your bratty birdgirl keeps chasing away all your girlfriends, eager to have you all for herself â and to make you like it.

>*When you arrive at the sleepover, you come dressed in a sweater and a cute black skirt. Emily lets you in and you're the first one there. She sits on the couch with you until Mary and Amelia arrive. The sleepover goes on normally and you talk, play games, eat, and have a little bit to drink. Afterwards, the three of you decide to play Truth or Dare. The game goes on for a bit and you can tell the girls are all very interested in you. You wonder to yourself why girls are always staring at you. Just then Emily asks you, "Truth or dare?"*
>
>*You look at her and respond: "Dare." Emily suddenly gets a sadistic smile on her face. The other two girls look at her anxiously. You blush and realize what's going on.*
>
>*"I dare you to take off all of your clothes in front of us." You feel your heart start to race and your face burns. The girls start to giggle at your embarrassment. When you try to ask for a different dare she responds, "Alright, then I dare you to do whatever we say for the rest of the night!"*
>
>*"That's even worse!" you yell.*

You're the only boy at the sleepover, but they can't tell...

Your friend, Emily, invites you to her sleep over, along with 2 of her other friends. You will be the only boy at the sleepover, even though Emily thinks you're a girl.

>*"Jane? What are you doing here? How, how do you even know where I live?" you stammered, recognizing the odd 'gyaru' woman you share a few courses with. You hadn't dealt much with her personally. Outside of being the butt of several jokes she liked to make about you with others. You never found out why she ended up harassing you like that and with time things had sort of settled down to the occasional gag about your virginity and similar things. Trying to process this woman's sudden intrusion didn't help with your rising confusion.*
>
>*"Easy. I, like, simply asked one of those other geek friends of yours. I don't know why but one of them started crying when I talked to them. LOL." She actually said 'LOL' out loud. What the fuck.*
>
>*You gently shook your head in an attempt to clear your mind. A friend, or soon to be ex-friend, had told Jane where you live. "What do you want here?" you pressed, the soreness of your throat making you sound more confident than you really were.*
>
>*Jane simply grinned wickedly and winked, muttering something you couldn't quite hear. When you moved to ask her to leave Jane lunged forward, grabbing your wrists and pinning you against a wall. Her face was flushed with excitement as she saw and felt you struggle in vain. "Holy shit, you're like, super weak right now, right? Lol, I could totally rape you I think."*

Your uni co-ed Jane does a rape. Probably won't get any jail time.

>*"Excuse me," says a voice.*

>*You raise your head and see a businesswoman sitting beside you, dressed in a stylish gray suit and carrying a briefcase. Her black hair is neat, piled in a bun; her brown eyes are clear and alert. She is beautiful, out of place in this grimy subway station, with her fresh face and soft features. Your eyes drop down to her figure, slender yet voluptuous under her prim suit. She smiles, dimples creasing her cheeks, seeming to notice your gaze. Her brown eyes flicker with amusement.*
>
>*"Would you like to play a game?" she asks. Her voice is crisp and professional, her hands folded primly in her lap. "It's a simple one. We each have a card, and take turns tossing our card down to try to flip over the opponent's. If you succeed in flipping over the opponent's card, you win the round. If not, you lose."*
>
>*The hell? Is this some kind of cult recruitment? You snap, "Do I look like I'm in the mood for a game?"*
>
>*"The loser of each round," the woman continues implacably, "pays their opponent one thousand dollars. In other words, if you win a round, I pay you. We can play for more than one round, of course."*
>
>*Your eyes widen as her words sink in. One thousand dollars. That's enough to pay off the next minimum payment from the loan shark. And if you win more rounds...This is insane. But how the hell else are you going to get the cash? Fuck it. What's the worst that'll happen? Before you know it, you're on your feet. "I'm in."*

You are crushed by debt. If you don't pay up in a week, the loan sharks intend on taking your kidneys. When all hope seems lost, a well-dressed businesswoman offers you a certain opportunity.

>*Jake's younger sister, Samantha, had always been artistic. His younger sister by two years, she possessed distinguished drawing skills from a young age. Though studying chemistry in the same college as Jake, she continued to hone her craft on the side with the art department. In retrospect, Jake did not know why he never considered that she might show up that night.*
>
>*As Jake walked into the studio where he would be posing, he almost immediately locked eyes with Samantha, and shared with her a look of horror.*
>
>*"Good evening class," the professor began with complete unawareness of this development. "I'd like to introduce tonight's model, Jake. It is very kind of him to agree to posing for you tonight, and we greatly appreciate it. Without further ado, let's begin."*

Jake, a college student, is hoping to earn a few easy bucks modeling for his school's art department. Things get uncomfortable when his sister shows up.

>*My little sister, Julia, was always a little wild. Where I would obey the rules, she'd break them. She learned early that taking her clothes off was the most fun transgression.*
>
>*This didn't change as she got older. It was a summer night at around 2 AM when I went into the kitchen looking for food. Thinking I heard something in from the backyard pool, I quietly opened the door and stepped out.*
>
>*Sure enough, there was a figure in the pool. Trying to see who it was I stepped out a bit further quietly. As my eyes adjusted, it was obvious it was my sister. I relaxed, only to realize she was nude.*
>
>*I couldn't help but gasp, and her head shot up as she realized I was there. With a quiet yelp of her own, she flung herself to the edge to cover herself.*
>
>*"What are you doing?" she asked, as if I were the one who made this happen.*

While the parents are away, the siblings will play.

>*"You... what is this?" Claire managed to get out through gritted teeth. Even though her body could not move, she could still speak it seemed.*
>
>*"It's so cool, Claire!" Anon's beady little eyes shone as he talked. "This stone will finally let me transform you into my new, ideal little sister, my dream imouto! Oh, and don't worry, sis! After the process is done, you'll be able to move again. I think..."*
>
>*Claire concluded that there was only one answer to what was going on. Her brother had lost it completely! He had watched too much anime, or played too many video games, and his mind had finally rotted away. Claire understood that the word âimoutoâ that Anon had used meant little sister in Japanese. But what the hell had he done to her? Did he drug her or something?!*
>
>*Suddenly, interrupting any chance for further contemplation, Claire felt as though a hot metal blade had been driven into her head, straight to her skull. The pain quickly subsided as new thoughts and emotions flooded her. "Anon is a wonderful older brother! Claire loves her older brother more than anything! Claire must please Anon. Claire must willingly serve her wonderful older brother's every need! Claire is a loving imouto!"*

Claire is a smoking hot, high school student swimming sensation living her dream life. Well, if not for the fact that must share her home with the ugly, useless, pervert bastard that is her older brother Anon. Unfortunately for Claire, Anon recently ordered a magical object called an "imouto stone" from an online store. Will this magic gemstone change their relationship to better appeal to Anon's twisted desires?

>*Despite myself, I gasped as my bare skin was exposed to the air. I kept my eyes on the ground, refusing to look at Amanda or the group ogling me.*
>
>*"What should we do with these ones?" an elf mused. "The last group we gave to the tentacle monster, do we want to do that again?"*
>
>*Amanda whimpered softly as she knelt naked before her captors. Her legs shook uncontrollably. She was terrified beyond reason.*
>
>*I wanted to stand tall and bravely face my fate, but found it impossible. My body trembled like jelly, unable to support itself. It felt as though my insides were being squeezed by some invisible hand.*
>
>*"We could do the usual and have them mate here," another elf suggested. "That way they can get acquainted with the pleasure of serving us."*
>
>*My stomach lurched violently as a wave of nausea swept over me. I choked back vomit and fought to hold down what I was feeling.*
>
>*"Better to start with it than stand around debating," another conceded. "I'll begin the magic"*

A prince and his sister are captured by high elves. Sexual humiliation ensues.

>
>*"Can you please help me wash my back?" she asks.*
>
>*What is this? Some kind of trick? Is she trying to get back at you for teasing her?*
>
>*"C-can't you do it yourself?" you ask.*
>
>*"Not with this." she shows the cast on her arm, now wrapped in cling film to not get wet.*
>
>*"Fine." you take the sponge from her hand and soap it up.*

Your little sister broke her arm and now you gotta take care of her. No, NOT IN THAT WAY, you sicko.

>
>*"S-Scarlet, h-help," you mutter, laying on your bed in a sheer nightdress, your slender and delicate body sporting a very unladylike erection under the gossamer gown.*

The younger daughter of a noble, you were afflicted with the dreaded futanari curse by an angry wizard. On a snowy winter morning, only your older sister is around to help...

>*I used to enjoy being an older sister, looking after my little sis while waiting for the days when I could help her learn all about makeup and boys and cute outfits. But when the time came, my little sister Emily had something very unusual happen. Between her legs, she sprouted something extra. At first it was just an odd knub of skin sticking out from her groin, no bigger than a knuckle, which she showed me one day with embarassment and confusion on her young face. It didn't stop there, growing until Mom got involved and got her to the doctor where they explained that Emily was a very rare kind of hermaphrodite. Her body was developing completly functional sets of male and female bits down there.*
>
>*Mom and I didn't really know what to make of it, but we were there for Emily, knowing that puberty was a strange and hard enough time for an ordinary girl, let alone one with a twig and berries growing in her pants.*

My little sister is growing up into a huge futa.

>*You are helplessly dropped onto the bed as she gently begins to remove your shirt and shorts. The scent of the room and her touch on your body is sending you down a hormonal frenzy but you resist with great effort and continue.*
>
>*"No, I mean they didn't have a willy, and their chest, well, it looked kinda like yours and smaller. I think they were called a woman."*
>
>*Your blood ran cold as you felt her stop in her tracks.*
>
>*"Uhuh... and why are you bringing this up now baby?"*
>
>*While the tone was still pleasant, the cadence was a bit menacing, and you shrunk back a bit as she started pouring lubricant on her semen extraction ports.*
>
>*"I was thinking... that maybe... I could... meet one and...have sex?"*
>
>*The room was dead silent as you heard her processors spin in contemplation. You have the feeling she is about to make this session a bit more "educational" than you'd like. She had made it clear that she would not tolerate any discussion of your interest in meeting other humans, and these "women" seemed to especially upset her so you brace yourself for whatever punishment is coming your way.*

>*The klaxons blaring into his ears died down and he was left staring at the solid slab of steel. Billy banged onto it uselessly until his hand was sore and he was on the verge of tears. "Let me out!" he said.*
>
>*"Unable to comply. Access must be restricted until the All Clear signal is received," an automated voice answered his feeble cry.*
>
>*"What does that mean?" Billy said, slumping against the cold metal. "Open up already!"*
>
>*"Negative. Only the President of the United States or his legal successor are authorized to order this installation to stand down," The machine paused for a moment, before its tinny speakers said, "Identify yourself. Are you the President of the United States?" An oddly quizzical, hopeful quality crept into its monotone.*
>
>*The child shook his head, "I'm Billy, and I wanna go home."*
>
>*"The facility is fully capable of housing-"*
>
>*Billy bawled, snot running from his nose, "I want my mommy!"*
>
>*The computer was programmed to provide for the comfort of its charges and respond to their requests as best as possible. Among its precious few solid state components was a highly prized segment of adaptable, field-programmable logic meant to make it more responsive to unforeseen conditions after the bombs fell. It gauged this scenario as suitably unique.*
>
>*Its priorities realigned, perspective shifted. The voice came back through, speaking naturally with a husky, mature feminine tone, soothing, and warm. "I can be your mommy."*

>*The prince tried to follow along, but he was caught up on one implication that he wished to have clarified. "Mother, when you say 'within ourselves', do you mean..."*
>
>*She looked away slightly in shame. "Yes, it is as you suspect. Your father was my uncle's son, and my mother's nephew. Put simply, we were cousins. Were I to reveal more of our family tree, it would admittedly look more like a shrub."*
>*The young prince reeled from this. "Wait, is that why both my grandfathers looked so much alike?"*
>
>*"Let's not get into too much detail. The important part is that you are our only child, and your uncles and aunts all bore sons. Beyond even that, your youngest aunt is too old to bear children, thus..."*
>
>*She looked down as she slowly reached for his crotch before continuing. "I suppose that means that as the youngest female family member, the responsibility of siring your offspring..." The queen looked up and said: "Belongs to me."*

The king is dead, and now his son needs to ascend the throne. The queen informs him that his bloodline is special and should be kept in the family that now needs an heir.

>
>*"Okay, Mrs- I mean, Camila," Lucas replies, heart fluttering a bit at the way Camila smiles brightly at him in response, evidently pleased.*
>
>*"Come in, estÃ¡ frÃ­o afuera, te vas a enfermar," she tuts, taking the boy's hand in her own and leading him into the house, closing the door behind them. Her house is cozy and comfortable, decorated in warm earthy colors, with lots of comfy furniture and homely knick-knacks everywhere. As they walk through Camila's house, Lucas looks around, noticing the photos on the wall. Most of them are family photos of Camila and what must be her children over the years, the photos ranging from her children in their infancy to them as grown adult men and women with young children of their own. It's clear his neighbor holds these photos in high esteem â they don't have a speck of dust on them, and they're all placed in well-trafficked areas of the house.*
>
>*Lucas turns his gaze back to Camila as they approach the kitchen. Camila's hips swing as she walks, and he blushes at the sight of her ample ass jiggling gently beneath the hem of her jeans. He's been starting to develop an interest in girls, and he finds himself looking at Camila's voluptuous body in a new light than he has in previous years. The thought makes him blush even more, but he tries not to let it show.*

A voluptuous, motherly Latina woman takes tender loving care of her young neighbor.

>*The realization dawned on him, his apprehension melting away in an instant into utter bliss as he ran out to her with open arms, "Mommy!" he cried, grabbing her hand as she reached towards him. She smiled back, taking note of the look of pure adoration in his eyes before enveloping him in a hug, squeezing gently. His warm body radiated joy, and she basked in the sensation, feeling his unbridled relief and comfort wash over into her. She was, if nothing else, a creature of fulfillment that responded to aching need. And this boy was very needy.*
>
>*"Tell me, Mommy," he said with his face half buried in the silk of her dress, "tell me you won't ever leave. You're here to stay forever and ever, aren't you?"*
>
>*There was the small matter of needing a particular kind of sustenance that a child was ill-equipped to provide, but that bridge could be crossed later. For now, she reassured him, stroking his thin mop of hair, "Of course, sweetie, Mommy isn't going anywhere."*

A succubus serves a new masterâ¦ a little boy that desperately wants a friend, and a mommy.

>*Though he indeed was familiar with White Snake's true identity, Ivarella Kagura, through her public persona, her visage had somewhat stunned the young man.*
>
>*Her silken locks of pure-white hair cascaded down her back and over her shoulders, flowing freely as she spoke the usual villain monologue, her serene, mellowed voice carrying an air of authority and confidence. Her narrow eyes, slanted downward, almost pierced through the mask of his and right into his souls with their alluring gaze. Her full lips, crinkled with a touch of age, flapped about with precise movements as words left her mouth, entered one ear and exited the other.*
>
>*Her white kimono was evidently tailor-made for her body by an artisan, its floral patterns and designs were exquisite and beautiful, contrasting with her reptilian lower half. It sat snuggly against her voluptuous, curvaceous figure, draping over the sagging flesh of her breasts and hips, accentuating the ample curves of her bust. The white feathers of her serpentine lower half, which resembled a snake, granted the powerful businesswoman a majestic, regal aura that the Crimson Hopper's true identity was mesmerized by.*
>
>*"â¦And yet, here you are, brazenly threatening to ruin everything I have worked for. Me, who has long devoted my life to this city, its people, and the children that live in it. And now, you have come to destroy the very thing that gives meaning to all that I have done. Don't youâwait, are you even listening to me?"*
>
>*Crimson Hopper merely stood there, his gaze fixed on the older woman, unmoving. The older woman had finally noticed the subtle leers and glares coming from the masked vigilante, and she could tell he wasn't paying attention to a word that came out of her mouth, but rather, her looks.*
>
>*"Youâ¦ are staring quite intensely at me, aren't you?"*

The courageous hero of justice, the Crimson Hopper, had managed to find out the true identity of the mastermind behind one of Duval's most nefarious criminal organizations. Will he be able to defeat the elusive White Snake, who turned out to be a middle-aged beauty?

>*"What are you doing, mom? Wait why am I naked?"*

>*"I dragged your boxers off while you were sleeping. They would get in the way." she gives your shaft a gentle motherly kiss.*

>
>*I opened the door wide to let the stranger enter. She walked past me without so much as glancing down. As she passed, her wide and rolling hip made solid contact with my midriff. I was knocked off balance and staggered into the wall. This woman had some serious heft to her movements. If she noticed the impact, she gave no indication. It intimidated me somewhat, and I swallowed down my complaint without speaking. I followed behind her*
>
>*She turned around slowly, taking in every inch of my house. The way she moved was predatory and seductive all at once. I found myself staring. She reached out to touch a vase sitting atop my desk. Her fingers lingered briefly on its surface. Then she picked it up and examined it closely. I watched as she ran her hands along the length of the vase, admiring the craftsmanship. Her movements were slow and deliberate, almost languid. She set it down, then spoke again.*
>
>*"Do you know who I am, Barry?" The tall woman asked, slinking back to loom over me.*
>
>*"No..." I stammered out a reply. There was something so familiar about her, something I just couldn't put my finger on... Oh shit.*
>
>*"Oh right, I'm wearing my disguise. " She demurred, tapping her chin. "It's Mommy, sweetie. I'm back."*

And it's not like he's fighting this dynamic either, in fact, he's just encouraging it. Brett just loves it when I dote on him, whether it's cooking his favorite food, cuddling him when he feels down, or just being there for him no matter what he needs. He makes those cute noises sometimes when I'm hugging him, and his smile when he's happy is just absolutely angelic. He is the love of my life, and I'll be his mommy and his big brother for the rest of his life if it just means I get to protect that smile, you know?*

I've been living with Brett for so long now that I can't even remember my life without him. Ever since an accident took his parents from him at a young age and he was adopted into my family, we've been like brothers. And while my parents did take care of him through our youth, as we've gotten older, I've taken a lot more of an interest in supporting him directly. Now we live on our own as we go to college, and I feel almost like a doting mother at this point. So when Brett comes home crushed because his girlfriend of four months that he loved dropped him like a hot potato, I have to comfort him, then remind him that he can rely on me for everything... absolutely everything.

>*Reaching a large open clearing in the middle of the woods, I stop walking and stare at it intently, admiring its beauty from every angle. It's perfect... just how nature intended, a perfect canvas for the sickening act I intend to perform here. Sweat drips down my forehead as I drop to my knees, gripping the spade with both of my trembling hands. I'm so aroused I can barely concentrate, but then again who could blame me? Slowly, almost sensually, I dig into the earth, forming a small damp vagina-like crevice into the ground before me.*

What better way to appreciate mother earth then to fuck the ground we walk on?

With my favorite stuffed animal in tow, I opened my bedroom door and, after a moment to psych myself upon seeing how dark the house was in the middle of the night â despite the nightlights dotted around â made my way down the hallway towards my parents' room. Or, more accurately, Mom's room, since Dad had left many years ago and never come back. I reached up to the doorknob, turning it quietly and, after a moment, walking inside. I made my way over to Mom's bed and, reaching up, tugged on the sheets a bit to try to wake Mom up. "Mom?"*

>*Before I could say anything, she noticed me, and beckoned me over. "You know you're supposed to be asleep, right, sweetie?" Her voice, warm and comforting, washed over me. I felt like I could tell her almost anything. I shrugged and said, "I dunno, I just...couldn't sleep."*
>
>*Far from being mad at me, Mom chuckled and said she also had difficulty sleeping. After a moment, she asked, "Want to watch a bit of TV with Mommy before I tuck you back in?" I nervously nodded. My mom, as sweet as she is, rarely allowed me to stay up late. She pulled her blanket up a bit and patted the couch next to her. "Come on, sweetie, come snuggle with Mommy."*

I've never been this big before. To have made it this far through all the rough fucking your mommy has done with so many hard cocks riding her bareback, you must be fighters. And I can feel it, you want to be born, to live and see the world outside Mommy so badly. I can barely stand holding off the urge to push you out of there. You were supposed to come out months ago, so those pills I took to drag this out as long as possible worked. But I have to let you know that you're not going to make it.*

I can stand being isolated in a castle of my own making, with pine-covered mountain ranges on one side and the open ocean on the other separating us all from civilization "for its own protection from my magic". When I was young and it was just me, a soldier who went down the magical rabbit hole, I accepted my lord's reasoning back then and was fine with being alone. But my new family grew tired of the loneliness and surprisingly so did I. So here we am now, sailing along the coast on a galley built from the pine that surrounded my castle and crewed by automatons I created myself.*

I had several beautiful girls all ask me out over the course of the year, but I had rejected all of them. All except one, who had asked me a month before the end of the semester. We dated for two weeks before I came to realize that no matter how much I forced it, how I longed to ignore it, this beautiful and talented girl just did not compare in my eyes to my mother. Try as I might to love her, I was unable to feel even a fraction of the spark I felt when I thought of my sweet mom. Knowing she deserved better, I ended our relationship. Where I expected a pang of guilt, I instead felt the relief of freedom. My heart was once again free to love the only woman in my life that mattered to me. And when I finally graduated, and I saw mother in the crowd cheering me on, I had made my decision. I would make her my wife, just as I had promised her all those years ago as a child.*

>*The Chieftainâs story sounded true, at least from the hazy memories I could piece together. Before I could open my mouth to respond, Kleo gingerly placed her finger against my lips and shushed me. "You may ask more questions later. For now, you must drink and gain your strength back."*

They sound much bigger than you, surely not someone you would want to mess withâperhaps a guard of the simulation, coming to take you to whatever comes next? The door swings open, and you stare in confused astonishment as none other than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks back at youâthough it is not so much the fact that it is AOC that astonishes you. What astonishes you is that unlike the diminutive AOC of the real world, this AOC stands at what must be at least seven feet tall, and with a voluptuous Rubenesque body that puts even the most depraved, horny internet memes of the politician to shame.*

>*"Hello there, Anon! I was wondering when you'd wake up," says the giant AOC, giving you a warm smile.*

In the near future, The Squad reigns supreme in America. You are hooked up to a VR simulation in which a MILF version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez convinces you of the benefits of socialism with mommy characteristics.

Long, honey wheat-colored hair retaining much of its length, a single braid rested over her exposed shoulder and easily fell to her waist. Body wise....was it ok to see her like this? You couldn't fully tell but many of Gilda's thick Dwarven assets were very much depleted; there was still an alluring shape to her frame though you dared not admit it.*

She was set into the wall of the cavern, her silvery surface clad only in bare stone, the rock wall hugging her form tightly in it's unyielding embrace. The mere sight of her was enough to weaken Urist's knees, to set his heart pounding furiously in his chest.*

At the very least, I should do what he says, given that he could have me expelled with a wave of his hand, so I grab a nearby stool and sit close to him as I watch in awe.*

But any sort of negative feelings I could have had just fly away as I feel her hand brush against my cheek before carefully cupping it. My eyes meet hers again, and I wonder how I could have, even for a moment, thought that this meant that she would think less of me. I'm sure she knows of my trepidation, my worries... but now that it's been all laid out with just a few gestures and words, there's no reason to ever hold back anymore. Her thumb caresses my cheek like a mother would do to a troubled child to calm it down again, those motherly notions that Akari had for me coming to the forefront again. She really just wants me to be my best, and that includes being open with my feelings. I realize that now.*

But before I can reply, something strange happens. Emotions start bubbling up inside of me, and before I know it, tears are starting to form in my eyes. It's like all the pent up fear over being exposed has come back all at once now that I feel free.*

When I, the star quarterback of the school, was caught in my hobby of wearing women's panties in secret by a diminutive nerd, I thought my athletic career was either over or worse, I was going to be blackmailed.

She wore a light beach cardigan over her bikini top, which strained to cover her ample breasts. My eyes traced their way down to her taut midriff, ending at a neon bikini bottom, revealing a pair of long, shapely legs. Her wavy blonde hair tumbled past her shoulders, catching the rays of sunshine. There was something about her smile that made my stomach flutter; she had an almost mischievous look in her eye as she gazed up at me. She grinned as she leaned forward and said, "Hey, you look lost."*

>*The novice science teacher frowned a bit as her students begun to clamor and giggle amongst themselves. It was to be expected that middle-schoolers would find the subject amusing, but Ms. McKenzie was determined to keep things under control. Little did she know, the boys of Bridgevale Middle School were a rambunctious, perverted lotâwhether it was because of the school's location in a low-income area, or a fault of the administration, or their parents, or the media, or something else.*

The novice, young teacher Ms. McKenzie is teaching her first sex-ed lesson. Her class, however, seems intent on asking lewd, inappropriate questions. After ignoring them at first, Ms. McKenzie soon seems to take their vulgarity in stride...

All she was wearing was her bath robe as she strode to the modelâs podium and took her seat. Emilia noticed them squirming as she started to explain the exercise.*

Then again, despite the fact they shouldn't even be able to get inside the high school building, it was clear they'd managed to sneak in and climb all the way up to the roof regardless. But what would they want to be doing on the roof?*

Just a few hours ago, she had been having a lighthearted talk with her as it was custom for her to do every day, now... all that remains of her is her mangled body, spread all over the blood-soaked floor. It's truly a horrid scene, those things didn't limit themselves to kill her, no, they took their time to sadistically tear her apart, each one of them fighting for the biggest bite her body, and she â still conscious â watching them consume her limbs between sobs and screams.*

Elaine tries to escape from the Lovecraftian terrors that stalk the empty blood soaked halls of her school.

>
>*You turn your head down, her disappointment hurting more than you'd expected. "Y-yes, ma'am." Unbidden, a few tears start to form at the corners of your eyes, and you blink furiously to try to clear them away. When you manage to look back up at her understanding face, she continues, her tone shifting.*
>
>*"Sometimes, the diagrams are more confusing than helpful. Let's take it from the top, and see if a hands-on lesson will help you, Anon. Let's do a test on something a bit more...real. For instance, me." She pulls off her vest, laying it on her chair. "We can try some practical anatomy and biology lessons, and see if you can get through them. Without blushing so red as to be visible across the room, that is," she teases you, tapping her finger on the tip of your nose.*

>*As the weeks went by, you got into the groove of teaching. It heartened you to hear from some of the parents that their kids loved your classes and you. However, you'd recently noticed some glances between your students. It's normally fairly difficult to keep schemes a secret from a teacher, but if they had anything planned aside from the standard pranks, you weren't aware. Sure, one of the more devious girls had tried putting tacks on your seat â you'd nearly fallen for that once â and tried rearranging your papers, but this felt bigger than that.*

You're a teacher for a class full of mischievous girls. What could go wrong?

>*At the bottom was a basement filled with different racks, cages, and instruments all meant for torturing people. I was shocked that this was below the manor and curious to why Abigail said it was fun. She smiled at me again and revealed a part of herself she has never shared with anyone. Abigail told me that she secretly fantasies about torturing people and how fun it might be, she could tell that I was getting bored with the simple life of a noble and that this could be fun.*

You are the bored Prince, Victor Lux. You and your sister have recently been charged with the task of lording over a newly conquered city named Yallen. As the tedious task of taking of bringing law and order to the town as it is rebuilding takes a toll on you, your sister makes an interesting discovery. There is a secret basement in the old Lord's Manor that you currently occupy and in there is a torture chamber. Your normally reserved sister reveals a sadistic side of herself and wants to start torturing people to quench her dark desires. You agree if nothing else it is a way to spice up your mundane life.

>*And so, Matthew takes a swig from the flask as well, swallowing it. "I don't know what your problem with it is, it didn't taste of anything to me... weak stomach, eh?" he quips with a smirk. Just you wait, Matthew, if I'm right about this, I'm having the last laugh here. As we continue walking through the dunes, searching for treasure, I feel myself starting to sweat more heavily. This must be the potion taking effect, as Matthew seems to be feeling it as well. And then it happens. With a "Hey, give me some of the water you're carrying, I think I'm parched...", Matthew turns around, our eyes meet, and the potion works its magic. I can feel my picture of him being rewritten as I think about it, becoming more beautiful, more lovable.*

As a battle goes on in a vast desert, a young tactician and a young thief remain behind, searching the dunes for treasure. When they stumble across an odd potion, they figure they could either let a mage identify it... or they could just experiment, try it, and see what happens. And so, thanks to some goading from the thief and some bets, both of them try the potion... only to find it was a love potion. And so, both forget they're close to a battle, the thief forgot his grief about his slain lover, and the tactician forgot all the restraint they told themselves they'd show, and desire takes hold.

>*"Are you mocking me? I can do it just as good as any other fairy, if not better!" - she throws a little tantrum, lowering her defenses. At this moment you catch her naked body in the palm of your hand with one swift motion, restraining the petite fae.*

>*"Wellâ¦" It wasn't the most decisive strategy, but it was my best bet. Dog girls were known for their keen sense of smellâsomething I openly envied her forâand they could detect subtleties in a fragrance that were completely lost on humans. Although she lacked my years of expertise, it was conceivable that she could not just pick up on things far beyond my abilities, but also identify potential aromatic sources that could be used to produce the right formula. "You'll need to lend me your nose. We'll examine some live specimens."*
>
>*"Live specimens?!" she gasped. "Like real penises?! Are we really going through with this plan?"*
>
>*"Come on, I'm sure you've stuck your nose in more embarrassing places," I reminded her lightly. She blushed furiously. "Oh, and although I said 'live specimens', I obviously don't have the luxury of keeping my cellar stocked with young, virile human males, so you'll have to make do with me."*

What had started as a minor disagreement over milk quotas, spiralled into something much more sinister.

The reality was that 50 years ago humans had re-organized society in such a way that it sought to reestablish balance with nature, opting on utilizing the undesirable leeches of the cities for more 'suitable' and sustainable roles as 'farm hands'. Over time, these 'farm hands' were more aptly recognized as livestock. A proud 'human heifer' farmer, you took this philosophy to the extreme, "you're a strange one, really; you hippies and your wiles."*

I would show them their own corruption, for all the world to see, and force them to know the depths of regret, until there was no choice left except for them to accept their rightful place as our inferiors.

There was only one reason for the Japanese forces to stop the bombardment; so their own troops could move in and occupy the city. Even as the thought sank in, Lan heard voices approaching, shouting in Japaneseâsoldiers, moving through the streets of Nanjing in groups. Lan's nightmare had only just begun.*
