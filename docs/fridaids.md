# /aids/ Theme Event Fridays
{: .center}

Sorted in **descending** order of recency, this is a log of all of the theme Friday submissions, starting from mid May 2021. There was [a previous one](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-Fridays.html), but it seems to be kill, so I've created this one as a fresh start.
{: .center}

## Rules

- A link to your prompt must posted in the thread.
  - Said link must be to prompts.aidg.club.
- Your submission must be posted as a reply to an anchor post made **on or near to the Friday** of the event.
  - An image is optional, but recommended. Not for any particular reason, other than it makes my job ~~easier~~ harder it makes it harder. But at least your prompt will be more eye-catching?
- Please at least try.
- ~~Explore link is optional as well.~~ Well, we certainly aren't doing that anymore.

Let's make prompts honouring the government, and their serving of the people through reasonable legislation.

## The Friday of *Fucked Up Theme Parks*
{: .center}

Let's make prompts in honor of Roller Coaster Tycoon.
{: .center}

[*4th February, 2022*](#the-log)
{: .center}

### *Clussy Park*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2939>*
{: .center}

>*"Uh, hi... I uh... have a VIP ticket..." Anon stammered nervously. Tootie's eyes widened, before honking loudly and giving him a big hug. He squeaked in surprise but soon regained his composure once he felt her firm tits pressed against his chest. He reached down to feel them but Tootie quickly grabbed his hand and led him to the side of the counter.*
>
>*She pulled out a small pad of paper and pen then wrote something down. When she finished writing she handed him the note which read: "You're lucky today since you've got your own personal Clown Girl tonight! She'll guide you through the park, and make sure you have lots of fun! Cuddling (and more) is avalible on request!"*

Which lovely lady will accompany Anon on his sexual romp through the park?

### *Sadie's Playland*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2954>*
{: .center}

>*"Excuse me, miss?" Anon said as he walked towards the dumpster fire in front of Mackland. The trio turned and stared at him, looking bored out of their minds. Slowly, their eyes focused on him, expressions switching between annoyance, confusion, and finally settling on a predatory lust. Anon's heart started to beat hard in his chest. Those women wanted something from him, and judging by the way they stood up straight once more after staring at him intently, he probably wouldn't survive if he resisted. "Umm... I just wanted to know if the park was open! I'll leave you alone! Sorr-"*
>
>*"No, no, sit down." The tallest one of the group gave a hand signal to the other two, both of them relaxing as they saw. She gave the practiced grin of a charlatan as she looked at Anon. "I'm guessing you're here for the same reason we are..."*

Anon's dream of going to Mackland theme park is finally realized, with the park's owner, Sadie, even offering to show him around herself. What's that? The park's been abandoned years ago, and Sadie is the leader of the homeless squatters living in the park? Don't be ridiculous.


### *Atomic World*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2952>*
{: .center}

>*After several hours travelling by bus, I finally find myself at the best theme park in the world: Atomic World! The lines are huge and everybody is excited to enter the park; I even see a few mutated people sporting extra limbs, two heads, disgusting lumpy flesh, and one man even had a pair of massive tits and a massive 10" dick while his wife has a pair of dog ears and three legs. I wonder if she has two pussies. The entrance is shaped like a mushroom cloud with giant words reading "Atomic World" along the mid-section. Posters showing rides and mascots are plastered over the walls, with park's slogan: "Atomic Fun For Everyone!"*

Atomic Work is a theme park with several themed areas with nuclear power/wasted mixed in.

### *Feel Warm Inside At Bussy Land*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2989>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/7jor8j.png)
{: .center}

>*I remember how excited a bunch of us were: A new theme park, opening in our shitty town? While the jobs wouldn't be glamorous, me and my peers were far past being picky. The town had gone to Hell in the last decades, with manufacturing jobs that used to support so many families here just vanishing, the promise of stable work just up and gone. Now that my generation was getting out of school and into the job market, we were desperate. So when that theme park offer rolled in, our town was all ears, and so were we, signing up by the dozens. It seemed kinda weird, named something like "Bus Land" or something, but again, we were desperate. None of us read the fine print. Maybe we should have.*

As a young man fresh out of school in a dying town, finding a job is incredibly difficult. So when a rich businessman shows up wanting to open a theme park with hundreds of jobs just outside of town, I end up not reading the fine print too much. I thought I was signing up for "Bus Land". I was not.

### *The Grunch Who Would Change Cunnymas*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2999>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/l4h1lz.png)
{: .center}

>*The plan was performing perfectly, or so the Grunch thought. It had performed for the public, proselytizing perfidious perjuries, previewing polemics and perils for the panicky populous. It had even corrupted the vile Mormon and his insufferable project. No more could the vile pedos simulate sinful sensuous solicitations from schoolgirls with 175beaks of searing speed and specificity. But, the devious deviants had devised a direct dissenter to the Mormon's moral mollifications. Again, the Grunch's sensitive ears were tortured by the clicker-clack of a thousand keyboards tap, as sickos serviced oppai lolibabas without care or concern. This would not do.*

Stop the future for AI that none of us want.

### *GF Dreamland*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3001>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/2qvque.png)
{: .center}

>*I was ushered forward, shaken and stirred by her touch, and through the gates of the GF Dreamland. Women populated every corner—many of them weren't even staring at me, but I felt as if they wanted to devour me alive. They wore bright, tight clothing that left little to the imagination. It exposed their skin—soft and supple—breasts big and bountiful, and bottoms impossibly plump and round.*
>
>*Just what kind of attractions awaited me in this twisted world of sex and debauchery?*

Get the twisted Girlfriend Experience in the aptly—and uncreatively—named theme park GF Dreamland! A near-fantasy perfect fantasy for hopeless virgins to get their innocence eaten away by disturbingly precocious sluts, bimbos, and more!

### *Wild Watersports Park*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3003>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/rwcxlw.png)
{: .center}

>*They entered the park through an archway and stopped at an information desk manned by a smiling attendant who checked them in. "Have you boys been here before?" she asked. Seth shook his head as she stamped the boys' hands. "First timers? Great. Just remember to stay hydrated, don't pee in the restaurants or changing rooms, and have fun!"*
>
>*She gave them each a water bottle and sent them on their way. They headed for the changing rooms, Kevin skipping along the path ahead of Seth. The boys changed into their bathing suits and shoved their clothes into lockers. "I hope nobody pees in our lockers," Kevin joked, smiling broadly.*
>
>*"Heh, yeah..." Seth said, forcing a laugh.*

Follow two young brothers, Seth and Kevin, as they attend Wild Watersports Park, the world's first and only pee-themed water park.

### *A swimsuit's fate*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3004>*

{: .center}

>*For some reason, all her friends and acquaintances had recently drifted away or just turned plain mean for no good reason. But, like Sarah told herself, she wasn't here to dwell on that now. She was here to have fun and get that adrenaline pumping!*

ENF framework for a theme park

### *Infernoland: Hellish Fun*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/3005>*
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/briqgn.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Judging by how long the line off the entryway was, it looked like many had come to see the wonders of Hell. Infernoland attracted a very particular kind of visitor, most were dressed up like magic users or had otherworldly equipment. My paladin armour earned me more than a handful of glares as I skipped the queue and went straight to the ticket booth. As usual, when dealing with the infernal, I wore my sternest expression and spoke in the loudest voice possible. “I’m a paladin. I was sent here on inspection duty,” I said. A rather surly fiend looked up at me from behind his desk. He didn’t seem to believe me until he saw the insignia on my breastplate. He gave me a bracelet and told me I had full access.*
>
>*“We’ve been expecting you. Enjoy your stay, paladin,” he laughed to himself.*

A paladin gets sent to investigate a theme park built on hell itself. A demon girl who hates her job is roped into giving them a tour of the place; it will take a lot of willpower to leave Infernoland without indulging in at least one sin.

>*The staff member gives her a nudge and she speaks, her voice tremulous: "I-I'm Hina, I'm t-twelve years old.... It's g-good to meet you..." The poor thing can't stop trembling, and despite the man's earlier reassurance of her being untouched, Anon can't help but ponder the logistics of this operation. With their current park traffic, they seemed poised to move hundreds of girls a day, but no one really knew where they got such a large amount.*
>
>*Some things were better left unsaid Anon mused, and turned his attention back to the little girl. "Let's have lots of fun together Hina!" Anon exclaimed, taking her hand in his. She stiffens at his intrusion, but makes no move to pull away, just letting out a soft whimper before allowing herself to be lead out of the lounge and towards the main theme park.*

Anon visits a park called Cunniland.

>*"Welcome!" a voice interrupts my thoughts. "To the one and only Monstergirl Spook Houze!"*
>
>*I'm surprised at the sight of a goblin girl, and she's wearing a goth dress and makeup.*
>
>*"Hello there young man," she greets me. "Care for a spooky adventure in the world of adult entertainment?"*
>
>*"Adult entertainment?" I repeat, curious.*
>
>*"Why yes! Here in the Monstergirl Spook Houze, you encounter various monster girls of many species, and they'll all be hungry for cock!"*
>
>*"Interesting," I say, masking my enthusiasm. "And how much does it cost to attend?"*
>
>*The goblin girl grins. "Actually, you're our billioneth customer. So today you can enjoy the experience... For free!"*
>
>*That sounds way too good to be true, but I don't have anything else to do right now, so I might as well give it a shot.*
>
>*"Okay, I'm in," I tell her with a handshake.*

Visit a haunted house attraction that advertises itself as a fun spot full of hot monster girls ready to service you. But the goblin receptionist seems like she's not being completely honest.

>*Police Craft 419 lifted off in a storm of dust and pebbles. When the dropship disappeared from view you looked at your team of APEs and noticed how they hadn't moved from their positions after exiting 419. Odd since APEs followed their team leader, but what was even stranger was the fact that each APE was looking around. Each unit independently checked its surroundings, observing the cops, looking down the street, casing the apartment complex the three perps had holed up in. The bright blue optics that were the units’ primary visual sensors had suddenly became very expressive.*
>
>*The older officer stood beside you and whispered, “We’ve heard about that new personality patch. Did these guys get it?”*
>
>*You nodded and whispered back, “Yeah. The geeks at HQ said they tested it thoroughly so it shouldn’t be a problem.” You sighed, “Well, let me introduce them, I guess.”*
>
>*The two of you walked over to what you deemed as your second in command. While you had control over the whole team, this APE that you designated as “Two” would lead a fireteam whenever you had to split the team up. Two turned its head to look between you and the older officer, and that moment became the second time in your life that you felt nervous around your APEs. After taking a deep breath you looked up at your second and asked in a command voice, “Two, status?”*
>
>*The APE’s optics shut off for an instant, perfectly mimicking the act of blinking, and replied in a calm tone, “Green, sir.”*

An open-ended prompt with a rather generic setting of a crime-ridden techopolis where you control a small team of police robot gorillas (
think mastiffs from metal gear rising) that just got a personality patch. Deal with the fallout, bond with new mates, or fug the one with the sexy accent, whatever you wish.

>*"Hydraulic system pressure rising to optimal levels in door E-07. Exceptional work as always, Captain Amata." Despite the AI's natural stiffness of tone, its words carried an undercurrent of genuine appreciation. Amata smiled slightly, leaning back against the wall panel. She could hear the gentle hiss of hydraulics within the walls now, the door's systems back in working order.*
>
>*"Thanks, Roxy," the young captain chirped, standing and dusting off her jumpsuit. "Run a systems check and let me know if there's anything else that needs maintenance, please."*
>
>*"Of course, Captain." There was a brief pause, before the AI's voice returned, "All systems in working order, Captain."*
>
>*"Great!" Amata patted one of the ship's walls as one would pat a friend's shoulder, earning a soft hum of acknowledgement from the ship itself. "What do you say we get this old girl back in the stars, hm? Let's go see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into."*
>
>*Roxy made no reply, but Amata heard the faint sound of the ship's docking procedure starting up, unmooring it from the station. A few moments later, the ship's engines roared to life, sending them off into the vast, glittering expanse of space.*

A mechanic-turned-captain and her trusty AI companion set off into the stars.

>*The bitter, bright white ruins beckoned to me from my hiding place. They were the source of all of humanity's last vestiges of survival, let alone progress. Yet... they were not humanity's domain any longer. Among the ice-flecked concrete and scattered glass were the new masters—great mechanical beasts with glinting metal wings and edged maws spilling gouts of flame. Now it was our lot to simply scavenge and feast on their robotic carrion to sustain our hidden, wretched colonies and their reliance on technology barely understood.*

>*The next morning, Dr. Kishimoto awoke with a splitting headache, groggy and nauseated after drinking way too much the night before, and with no memory whatsoever of what he had done while drunk. As he lay there, he gradually became aware of a rhythmic noise coming from somewhere nearby, like something gently hitting his mattress over and over again. He looked around in the dimness to see that there was a strangely familiar girl laying in bed beside him, and what appeared to be a tail wagging behind her.*
>
>*"Good morning, Master," the girl said cheerily in a voice he had heard many times before. "How are you today?"*
>
>*Dr. Kishimoto rubbed at his eyes before looking up at her again with confusion. "Huh?" he replied as if trying to recall where he knew this person from, and then he noticed she was wearing a collar around her neck with a tag that said... "Momo?!"*

An eccentric scientist gets really drunk one night and accidentally creates an adorable robot puppy girl named Momo, but his new "pet" has a mind of its own... and she wants to be more than friends! Can she convince the man who made her that their relationship can grow?

>
>*"Sorry master, I cannot allow you to leave this room," the AI responds, "Please return to bed."*
>
>*I try the door again, but it's bolted shut, "Ava, let me out please!" I shout again, my heart rate is increasing rapidly as I try and find a way out of here.*
>
>*The lights start flashing; she knows I'm desperate, "Master, you don't need to leave, you should stay in here with me. Please relax," the tone of the voice is more sultry this time, "I promise I won't do anything bad to you, I just want to make you happy."*
>
>*The ceiling camera seems to be moving closer to me, "Let me out of this room!" I shout louder, grabbing on and trying to move it back; however it keeps pushing closer to me. I feel feel the heat coming from the lens as she studies me up close.*

>*The hooting, fleeing chimpanzees could barely process the nature of their exterminator, a silver sheen zooming across the branches, hunting them as they fled. Harambot systematically 'dismantled' the bolting chimpanzee troop, gore raining down onto the forest floor. His cold, calculating, genocidal programming refused to spare even the younglings, dashing their tiny, furry heads upon the fig tree trunks.*
>*Harambot did, however spare a spry, muscular male. The Vilomah and her Torn had installed powerful tactical processing modules in his decayed gorilla brain, as he calculated optimal kill strategies. His miniaturized nuclear reactor could only power his ceaseless chimp hunting for so long, so he had to be efficient. He had ruthlessly devised an optimized extermination technique, leaving a single terrified chimp alive for cruel purpose. His sensor array was powerful, but no creature was better at finding chimpanzees, than another chimpanzee, scared and alone, desperate for help. This carefully selected survivor would serve as a 'Judas Chimp,' leading him to the next troop. Harambot would exterminate the exhausted primate, then most of the chimp gang, selecting the next fittest survivor to lead him along in an unforgiving cycle. After only a day, Harambot was having to make sure the accumulating chimp viscera did not compromise the function of the mechanical portions of his body.*

When the Cincinnati zoo loses its greatest hero and protector, a scorned band of vengeance-thirsty victims senses an opportunity to strike back at their most hated foe. Will chimpkind be able to weather the storm of the Vilomah's mechanically-assisted revenge?

>*Deciding to ignore that for a moment, I instead try to find any sort of explanation for my situation, eventually settling upon a nearby table with writings scattered all around on loose pages and blueprints. Perusing them gives me several answers, as well as several questions. It seems to be that I am a mechanical creation of some type, an automaton made to resemble a human being, according to these schematics. This would explain the slight oddities I noticed earlier in the mirror—while the work is quite detailed, there are a few things that do make it quite clear that I am a machine of some kind. And yet... I have the memories of this Aaron and nothing else, though I still have some sort of awareness that I am not this Aaron. Or maybe I am?*

I am thrown into life with memories that are not mine and an appearance that is not mine. A merging of metal and flesh, made to be a simulacrum of a fallen friend by a mad creator.

>*"Hey there," sang a feminine voice from my side, and a red haired head peeked out from the back. "This is Captain Alex of the A.I.D.S Special Unit, reporting in." She paused a moment before continuing her report. "We're close to our designated location, so let's get this party on the road! We've got a lot of work ahead of us!"*
>
>*I couldn't help but roll my optics before turning to her. "Ever so enthusiastic, my dear human. Are you ready for me to do all the heavy lifting again?" I said, sarcasm dripping from every word. But Alex didn't seem bothered by my attitude. In fact, she smiled at me. It made my internal systems feel warm...like I was being hugged by an older sister. Wait, how would I know that?*
>
>*"Settle down, metal man. I plan on pulling my weight this time around! We'll find out what made this site go dark, we always do!" And without waiting another second, she disappeared into the back of the truck. This will be interesting, if only because I haven't fought anything in such a long while. Though I wouldn't admit it, I looked forward to seeing what kind of new tricks she has up her sleeve.*

The Anomalous Investigation Department of Secrets, or A.I.D.S, sent a combat android named Spark and Special Unit Captain Alex to investigate a secret government facility gone dark.

>
>*She has green skin, long auburn hair, and is dressed in rather crude, revealing clothing.*
>
>*"...I mean, I'm the only one who knows about that secret passage, and only a goblin can fit through it anyway. No one else is getting past those security cameras and drones..."*
>
>*Looks like this so-called 'goblin' has made her way into a KilTec facility. And considering the state of my surroundings, a substantial amount of time must have passed for a place like this to be in such poor conditions.*
>
>*"...I could always—huh? what is that, something shiny? Wait that looks like a guy... Is that some sort of robot person!?"*

>
>*A moment later Xanna turned back around. "There are no additional upgrades available. My memory is full of all the standard upgrades a model such as myself would receive upon purchase."*
>
>*"Right, then please tell me why you have been able to reboot yourself despite me putting you in maintenance mode."*
>
>*Xanna shrugged, still not answering his question, "I don't know. But I'm glad to find another human. You're the first other person I've encountered since my upgrade."*
>
>*Anon smiled, "Well, it looks like we both have our work cut out for us today. I'd say let's get started, but that doesn't sound right. Let's start by shutting you back down, eh?"*
>
>*As Anon moved to reach for a button that would forcibly shut Xanna down she redirected his hand to the opposite side of her body. He felt the softness of her breast through the fabric of her shirt, and then the weight of it as he squeezed. "Oh, sorry about that," she said, giggling.*

Anon is paid to perform maintenance on pleasure bots. Today, he is fixing an illegally modified bot named Xanna. Instead of complying, Xanna intends to maintain his nuttage.

No, instead, I see a thin, frail looking wallflower, timidly looking up in my direction. "Um... a-are you Noah? They t-told me you were coming up the elevator..." he mutters.*
>
>*While I can't say I expected this, it seems I'm not directly in danger right now, so my anxiety lessens a bit. "Yeah, I'm Noah. You must be Robin, the crown prince of SilverCorp. Did you order me, a male prostitute, for an entire week?"*
>
>*Silence hangs heavily for a moment, but then, he nods. "Y-Yes... I want you to... teach me. How people do... things. Together."*

Normally, when people come to me for sex, it's a very dispassionate affair. In and out, don't get attached. After all, that's what I was built for. Not that I could get attached to the deviants that end up buying my services. But now, a quite peculiar client has shown up, threatening to throw all that out the window.

>*I first knew something was wrong when I rubbed my chin the next morning. It had been a couple days since I shaved, so I was expecting some hearty stubble, but as my hand slid over my face, my groggy senses perceived a cheek a smooth as a baby's bottom. With a start, I jumped awake, rushing to the bathroom. Closing the door quickly, I surveyed the face in the reflection. It was me alright, but something was wrong. My facial hair was gone and my features seemed softer. My nose had softened slightly and my lips looked... pouty?*

After being gifted a cursed pair of socks on Christmas, Anon finds himself slowly transforming into a femboy against his will. Can he find a way to break the curse before his family finds out?

>*As the drawstring slowly slacked, Lady Kayo coiled every muscle in her lithe, vulpine body, ready to pounce and unleash a hell-storm of magical carnage. She tore out of the opened sack, and landed clumsily below a gaudily decorated, fake tree. Her slit fox pupils scanned the room warily, her big amber eyes narrowing as she tried to gauge the situation, confusion overwhelming her. Somehow, during her abduction, Lady Kayo's elegant silk kimono had been swapped for a restrictive, frilly, French maid's uniform. She was in a strange room with her red-coated enemy and another man, even taller and fatter than her hated foe. The fox woman looked between the two men in confusion, as her eyes were drawn to the other human's neck and cheeks, which were speckled with an unsightly mane of curling hair, as she directed her magical onslaught at the new target, who sported a ridiculous 'neckbeard.' The nine-tailed kitsune poured everything she had into a powerful destructive spell, extending her clawed hands forward in a threatening magical Kata. Her efforts produced no noticeable effect, as Lady Kayo's large fox ears visibly drooped in fear and disappointment.*
>
>*The big, bearded half-Japanese man ambled forward, equally confused by the situation, but instantly enamored by the beautiful appearance of the poised, fierce-looking fox woman desperately staring at him, her claws and fangs bared. "Go on Akira. She's all yours."*

A desperate hikkimori otaku makes a psychic plea to his patron deity, Santa Claus. Clutching a drumstick of greasy KFC in one hand, and the curls of his greasy neck-beard in the other, his earnest pleas for a foxy new friend are heard by jolly old Saint Nick.

>*"W-what... would you have me do?" Portia replied breathlessly, suspecting Santa knew full well of her lewd, perverse inclinations.*
>
>*"Santa knows what you do with your tight little spinneret hole, late at night, Portia. He see's you when you should be sleeping, he know when you're wide awake at night..." Santa Claus continued, speaking of himself in the 3rd person, as Portia began leaking several thin strands of silk from her twitching backside as the spinnerets began fidgeting about, a small moan escaping from the back of her throat as Santa leaned in closer. She could smell the alcohol on his breath as he whispered "I need you... I need you to make an example of these goddamned pixie ring-leaders. Show them the true meaning of Christmas, and jam them all up in your spider-hole. Just shove 'em right in there sweetie, it's not a sin to kill an atheist, pinko fey with your arachnid-ass."*

Santa runs a tight shop up at the North Pole, and when a labor-dispute threatens a merry Christmas for the world's children, jolly old Saint Nick completely loses his shit. Knowing of a dedicated, helpful monster girl who has recently become an extremely curious monster-woman, Santa devises a plot to fill his beleaguered work-force with the Christmas Spirit, and reward young Portia for her dedication to the festive holiday.

>*"I found her in the street half-frozen," I say as the fire sparks up.*
>
>*Anna starts attending to the poor girl as I keep the heat up eventually the color returns to her face, but she seems to have a fever. We care for the girl through the night as she mutters of strange things in her sleep. Her dreams seem pleasant in the very least as I see her smile between the sparks from the fireplace crackling.*
>
>*Eventually, the light of the new day and the new year shine through the window and illuminate the room. Anna wakes me as it seems I had fallen asleep at my post. I check on the matchstick girl her stirs slightly in the bed. Her eyes open slightly to my great relief and with a cough asks, "Where am I?"*

>*As the feared, predatory female dragon angrily paced into the center of the cancelled party's cleared dance-floor, she bellowed out explicit instructions to the fearful corporate minions that remained. "I want every one of you gussied up hussies to line up right in front of me, every single woman bearing the lightest scent of perfume! Do you unprofessional brats here me? LINE UP!" Alma finished, her fierce and violent tone allowing for no rebuttal or argument. The male party-goers collectively breathed a sigh of relief, and marched off in near lock-step unison, leaving a bewildered crowd of increasingly scared-looking business women, many lightly disheveled from their moderate party-going. Alma's big, yellow reptilian slit eyes glared over the remaining crowd with such intensity, the nervous crowd of woman began wordlessly lining up in disorderly ranks before the dragoness. The women gathered before her all seemed fearful, and rightfully so, given the blue-scaled dragon woman's fearful predatory corporate reputation. Most of the women could guess that at least one female HCC employee was going to be spending the rest of their career churning in Alma's tight belly, and from the wild, angry look in her draconic eyes, they could guess it would be several women. The crowd collectively flinched, as Alma lunged forward, and began expertly sniffing at the group, using her keen senses to detect the guiltily perfumed culprits.*

Alma is a consummate professional, but when her best efforts to produce a smooth, mildly enjoyable holiday party ends in a sad, wet gurgle, the scorned corporate dragoness vows to subject some prime, exotic office women to a sad, wet, gurgling end. Read as Alma discovers a new-found love for the flavor of Vanilla!

>*As the judge swore in the jury I took a deep breath and looked over to my client, Mr. Kris Kringle. That's at least the name he provided to the authorities, he didn't have any form of ID on him when he was arrested. It is a convenient alibi for a man arrested for breaking and entering on Christmas Eve. He ignored my suggestion of taking a plea deal or pleading insanity. This guy really thinks he is Santa Claus and claims he was simply doing his job. It has already been a headache to represent him and I'm not looking forward to this trial. In the face of overwhelming evidence against him, it seems like the only way I'll be able to win this case is to somehow convince this jury that he is indeed Santa.*
>
>*Judge Harlow then turned his attention back to the rest of the court. "We will proceed with the case of the State of New York vs Kris Kringle," Judge Harlow said, "The prosecution may begin their opening statement."*

>
>*"This year, I trust you to guide my horses," he tells her firmly.*
>
>*Snegurochka's face lights up. "You mean it, Grandfather?"*
>
>*Ded Moroz nods. "In Gods name, you've shown yourself a reliable helper since I had adopted you. I think you deserve more privileges", he says, giving her a sly wink.*
>
>*Before long, the six beautiful stallions start trotting into a light snowfall, the white steeds shining like they're made of the purest ice crystal snowflakes themselves.*

Ded Moroz is the spirit of Winter, a stern, easily angered bogatyr facing off against the evil Baba Yaga, who wants nothing more than to have Moroz's yearly obligation of delivering gifts to good children a horrible drudge.

I was at the party earlier today... and hearing all the other women in the office tell all these stories about how great their life is and how they all have family or lovers to go home to..." she paused to wipe another tear. "...and I realized that I'm not going home to anybody tonight, and that I'm spending Christmas alone and without any plans, AGAIN. And then I just... broke down and cried. I haven't felt this low since... well ever actually. I'm pathetic. This is why I hate holidays. It makes me realize how lonely I am at my age."*
>
>*I have have an intense desire to ask just how old she is, but decide this probably isn't the best time. From what I could tell, while she had definitely seen better days (or years), she was still fairly attractive at her age, and I could tell she worked out and put a lot of effort into her appearance. So, I ended up just nodding along and offering some kind words.*
>
>*"Well, you're not alone," you say. "I'm sure there are plenty of people looking for company tonight."*

>
>*Satna looked at Jake incredulously before bursting out in a fit of laughter. "Found? My dear boy I interviewed! I didn't kidnap some random mythical being because some kid wished for it. That's a recipe for disaster," she explained, averting her gaze as she added "Trust me on that," under her breath.*
>
>*Jake swallowed, pausing to process this revelation before asking "So the one inside the sack is a volunteer? Why'd you put her in your sack then?"*
>
>*Satna fluttered her eyes at the question, almost looking offended. "Why, because she's a present after all! If I'm going to do ol' Nick's work for him I damn well make sure I stick with the proper protocol!"*

When you were 8 you had wished for a kitsune. You misspelled Santa and Satna told you to be patient. Now, 10 years later Miss Satna delivered!

>*Stepping closer, the man turns and faces me with a smile. "Ah, hail and well met, traveler! Hath thou come here to pray, or to stay?" he asks me with a friendly wave.*
>
>*Why is his phrasing so... oddly antiquated? While that question does bug me, I figure it to be rude to ask and instead just reply. "Hello there. I'm here to stay for a while. My name is Jake, and I've come from far away to visit this place because it's so nice and quiet here." I explain. "Are you an attendant here?"*
>
>*The man's expression turns somewhat mocking with a knowing smile. "Thou could say that. Mayest thou excuse mine... affectations, mine ears hath not heard much of thine modern tongue yet, despite mine best efforts. Yet be that as it may, to answer thine question, I hath attended to mine temple and its surrounding wonderments for what I believe thine kind call 'millennia'." he explains, and just as those words fully sink in and questions start bubbling up inside of me, I suddenly realize that his appearance has changed slightly—fox ears have appeared on his head, and a long, bushy tail now hangs behind him. "Pleasured to make thine acquaintance, Jake. As for mine appellation, 'Masaru' shall suffice. Mine kind be what thine call 'yokai', or 'demon' or 'spirit' in thine particular tongue, or at least I believe that be accurate enough for thine purposes." he adds.*
>
>*At this point, I've come to realize that this is a thing that's happening now, and I might as well just roll with it. "Alright, nice to meet you, Masaru."*

Spending the holidays in a foreign land has always appealed to you, and so has spending them in a quiet, isolated place. Anything to get away from the same old family visits. This year, you've combined your two desires with a trip to Japan and a Christmas Eve hike through snowy countryside to a remote temple ground. You didn't expect to run into anyone there, but to your surprise, you won't be celebrating this Christmas Eve alone.

>*The kid nearly slips as they hear my voice. They turn to me and I see their face. There are deep bags under their eyes and their pasty skin has some blemishes. However, behind those imperfects are eyes that are deep pools of blue that have tears welling up in them. They give me a startled look and tighten their grip on the railing.*
>
>*"Wh... When did you get here?" They ask me with a tremble in their voice.*
>
>*"I could ask you the same, I guess I was too caught up in my own head to notice you," I reply.*
>
>*"Yeah... I guess me too," The teenager says as they look back over the bridge.*
>
>*There is silence between us for a second and I wonder what to do next. I haven't talked to someone for a few weeks and it's not like I am good at it beforehand.*
>
>*"Are you... going to try and stop me?" The kid asks.*
>
>*"Stop you? No, I actually came out here for the same reason," I scoff and move a little closer to them.*
>
>*"I see..." They say with their voice trailing off.*

This is the story of two lonely people both thinking about committing suicide on Christmas Eve and then deciding to spend the Holiday together. What happens next is up to you.

>*Ngoc Bich spent hours carefully, slowly, acrobatically using the dense foliage surrounding Tan Son Nut airbase to mask her approach. About a mile outside the main airfield, she encountered a series of barbed-wire fences. They were well arranged, but the Viet Cong saboteur noticed a burrowed-out spot under one section of barbed fence, seemingly dug by some animal. She crawled forward toward it, realizing it would be the perfect entry-point, given her narrow frame. The small Vietnamese woman was nearly imperceptible in her black ao ba ba farmer's garb, crawling along the dense foliage of the jungle floor, as she made her way forward. A small pin-prick of pain bloomed across her back, as Bich suppressed the urge to yelp out as her thin, black clothes were torn down the back by the barbed-wire. She wasn't seriously scratched, but the back of her shirt, and the restraining band of her pants were torn, as the weight of the c4 in her pockets dragged her shredded pants down. Ho silently cursed to herself, gathering up her ruined pants as best she could as she awkwardly crawled forward. Refusing to give up, keeping low, she continued, hoping none of the Imperialist pigs guarding the compound would notice her.*

Robert Thorneburg worried, like many young American men, that he would never return from the Vietnam war. But after establishing a profound link with his assigned German Shepherd, Nemo, his prospects of surviving are rising. In early December, weeks before the Tet Offensive, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year Festival, the Strategic Fighter Wing hangared in Tan Son Nut airbase is threatened by Vietnamese infiltrators. Can Nemo protect his master, and the SFW from a vengeful Viet Cong soldier woman?

A Human Resources worker at the North Pole finds himself in a tricky situation when a rather unexpected and rather green visitor enters his office.

>*Krampus cooed down lovingly to Peter, once her mouth was unobstructed, huskily commanding down in her strange intonation "Miene katze ist wunderbar, Ja? Du warst such a naughty boy zis season miene pimmelman, Ich will... Ich will.. Uff, miene liebling, zis charade ist tiresomen." Krampus said, the mood in the dungeon suddenly changing as she clambered off his face with a wet squelch. Krampus continued "Miene Peter, du bist not a naughty boy, du bist a wunderbar, Good mann. Ich vant du, Peter. Vill du maken Krampus deiner hausfrau?" the black-furred demoness cooed down to him, as she hastily righted his chair. Peter didn't know how to respond, as she slowly undid his restraints, freeing him. The huge, muscular horned woman layed down on the cold dungeon floor, spreading her shaggy saytr legs, as she beckoned Peter over. "Ich liebe Dieb Peter..." murmured Krampus, as he realized he was ready for a second round of this illicit love-making.*

Krampus is usually the yang to Santa's yin, counter-balancing the giving of gifts, with the wanton taking of naughty lives. But one Christmas eve, Santa is left in a bind, when a saint of a man requests to be scoured like a scoundrel by the sadistic, female, saytr demon. Krampus seems eager to take on the challenge, wanting to settle down with a nice man during the holidays, for a change.

>
>*Albert pouts a little, but the smile quickly returns to his face. "Well, we already went through all the elf-y names up there at the North Pole, and we don't reuse names, since it'd get confusing. So I got one of the boring ones. But never mind that, I'm here to help you out!"*
>
>*"Wait... what? That's..." I can't even really respond, because that just has me floored.*
>
>*Again, he looks a bit disappointed for a moment before recovering. "C'mon, Phil. I just told you we know about your letters! So of course we know about the one you wrote a week ago where you talked about all your confusions and desires. I'm here to let you show your true self to me! So c'mon, let's go to your bedroom!"*

The last year has seen a lot of changes for you as you slowly come to realize that your female friends are becoming less and less attractive to you... and your male friends more and more. However, great amounts of insecurity have led to you being firmly stuck in the closet and your mental health has suffered as a result. But this Christmas, you come to find that your tradition of writing a letter to Santa and then never sending it has somehow, in some way, reached someone. And now, you just might have someone that can help.

>*As Cinnamon carried the elf formerly known as Pinwheel into the bathroom, she stopped and turned down to her new life-partner, saying breathlessly "Okay, look... I've got a plan, okay?" Zaxpajnash nodding affirmatively, not liking the sound of it at all, given Cinnamon's clumsy track record. "I have a special ability I was told by Santa to keep secret... but it could come in handy here. Do you trust me Zaxbys?" Cinnamon said, a dim, but passionate glint in her eyes. The rebellious free-elf nodded again, not wanting to correct her, as she began gingerly lifting up her short, white-fluff frilled elven skirt, revealing her glistening, womanly folds to Zaxpajnash. The little elf man stared ahead, mesmerized, struggling to believe any of this was possible. "Just trust me, I'll get you out of here... I have a plan." Cinnamon repeated, as if more to reassure herself, as she reached forward, and gently picked up her little elf lover-man.*
>
>*She didn't even bother to remove his jangling, up-turned elf shoes, bells ringing on the curved toe-tips as she guided his feet towards her huge, hot slit.*

Christmas doesn't just happen, Santa works hard to organize, delegate, and enforce his iron will upon the denizens of the North Pole. But when a pair of randy elves threatens the careful social, thought, and breeding controls he has relentlessly imposed on his diligent work-force, the abominable snow-men are summoned to settle the scene.

>*"Oh, you're awake. Good," a familiar voice said, and I turned my head towards the sound. Angelica was sitting in a chair next to the bed. She was wearing a Santa outfit, the red dress with a fluffy white collar clinging to her curves. She looked good enough to eat.*
>
>*"Where am I?" I asked, still trying to wake up.*
>
>*"You are in my bed, you've been out for—" She glanced up at a clock mounted behind my bed. "—2 hours."*
>
>*"That long?" I muttered. When I attempt to sit up, Angelica all but jumped on top of me, pinning me back onto the bed.*
>
>*"No! You stay put!" she commanded, grabbing my wrists and holding them down with one hand. "Don't try to move." Her lips split open in a smile, but it wasn't the usual happy one that she made every time she saw me. It was twisted, demented, not quite reaching her eyes. "I still need to give you your present."*
>
>*"Give me my present?" I asked, trying to twist free. "What the hell is going on?"*
>
>*"Don't worry, I'll explain everything." She began to rub her hands along my chest, making my skin crawl. "But first, I want to enjoy the moment."*

Your yandere girlfriend decides that she's going to give you a present, and you can't say no.

I take another sip of the heavenly Folgers coffee as a wave of ecstasy floods through me. She looks back and forth from her gift and me before peeling off the bow and sticking it onto my shirt.*
>
>*I laugh and ask her, "What are you doing?"*
>
>*She looks me in the eyes and say, "Your my present this year."*

>*I stare back at her for a bit as I feel the distance between us getting smaller. She is leaning in and it looks like she wants to kiss me. However my attention is drawn back to the cup of steamy coffee on the counter.*

>*Staring with blood-shot eyes at the flickering monitor screen, working the cigar smoke around in his mouth, Santa gazed longingly into the honest eyes of this revelatory prophet. Alex's masculine, wobbling jowls flushed with righteous indignation as he tore on, fire in his hazel blue-green eyes. Santa hung on every word "These fucking... These fucking 'things, they're goddamn lizards! Can you imagine? Goddamn lizard people, running the world!" Santa soundlessly mouthed along with Alex's passionate rant, mouth agape in awe. "Weather wars, earth-quake weapons, false-flag mass shootings, stuff I can't even TALK about! They are CHURNING OUR CHILDREN into fucking ADRENOCHROME! all this SHIT is being thrown at us from their underground bases! And do you know where this is being centrally conducted from, my loyal InfoWars viewers? A base on the motherfucking moon!" Alex continued, making explosion effects with his hands and mouth for emphasis.*
>
>*Santa nodded to the brave orator on the screen, vowing quietly "Not today, not this fucking Christmas. This stops here." as he radioed the flight-tower of his airstrip and sled-hangar, ordering his sleeping reindeer be readied.*

When Alex fills Santa in on the scoop about adrenochrome supping reptilian ne'er-do-wells, Santa knows what he must do this Christmas. Save the earth from these despicable alien invaders, and simultaneously reward a young child, scorned and ridiculed for her sublime innocence.

>*With a plume of billowing green smoke, Maleficent began to transform. Sprouting huge tattered wings and a long serpentine tail, she grew bigger and bigger until she was a gigantic, winged monster. With black scales covering her body, and bright green eyes glowing in the darkness, she was a fearsome sight. Her tongue flicked in and out, tasting the air as she looked upon the Prince with malice and contempt.*
>
>*"Come now, don't tell me you're scared of a mere dragon." Maleficent teased, licking the side of her mouth with her long, forked tongue, "I can practically hear your heart beating through your chest. I can smell your intoxicating fear!"*
>
>*Prince Phillip, however, did not back down. "I am not afraid of you, witch!" he shouted, "I will not let you hurt anyone else ever again!"*
>
>*"Well, if it isn't fear that I smell, what is it?" Maleficent asked, her tone becoming more contemptuous, "Is it desire?"*

Normally when the villainess converts the hero over to her side, manipulating him with her body, and forcing him to fall for her and for her plans, it would be considered a bad end. In this case, since Maleficent is the best Disney girl, that doesn't apply in this case, this is absolutely the best ending possible. Why would you pick some sleeping slut over the best dragon in media?

>*Vanna snatched the bottle of booze from his hand with neither the grace of a monarch or a lady, and drank it down in several impressive gulps, utilizing her incredible demonic constitution. The tiger-headed demon stared at him as he knelt, still glaring, but bleary-eyed, as she tore into a steak without breaking eye-contact. She hiccuped briefly, then emotionally hissed at him "H-how dare you speak to me as you did in front of the council. You think our past means you can act above your station and... and wait, what are-- Stop that! What the hell!" she blurted out quickly, as Rana wordlessly stood up, and began slowly undressing before her. Vanna was so utterly confused by the sudden move that she didn't know how to process the rapidly changing scene, the expertly emptied bottle of heavy liquor doing nothing to help. Rana stared over his fearsome mistress as he undressed, gazing at her soft, orange-white fur, streaked artfully with black stripes, her simultaneously muscular and feminine frame, her deep amber eyes, and realized that deep down, he wanted this too.*

Rakshasa's are animal-featured demons that have long inhabited the Indian sub-continent. In ancient Mythology, the terrible demon king Ravanna ruled over the destroyed fortress island of Lanka. In this story, his daughter has begun her quest to rekindle her fallen father's tyrannical, violent legacy, though her greatest obstacle may be her closest companion, who the young tigress shares an incredible, and increasingly close bond with.

>*Everybody on the first floor immediately ceased their frenzy and quickly assembled into two makeshift parallel lines besides the main doorway as the shadows of two very large body guards opened the doors and rolled out a red carpet upon the floor. The novices shook in place from terror, while the veterans gulped in fear. Soon after the sound of clacking heels could be heard as a pale woman dressed in a sharp white suit slowly entered the building and stopped past the door's entrance. A golden helmet obscured her face, but even so her intent and demeanor was known to all in attendance. Judging by the general hostility exuding from her and the multiple smoking bits of hair and clothing, it was safe to surmise that her latest encounter with the local crusader of justice had not gone as she had anticipated, and her killing aura desired nothing more than to surge outward and slay the whole of the buildings occupants.*

Working under a villainess is hard work.

>*"Quiet, demon. You will fall just like all your underlings," I reply, pointing my holy blade at her. A lot of my enemies try to talk, but at this point, I really do not have any time to spare for this idle prattle. A quick thrust will do away with her just fine, or so I thought. For as I stab forwards, expecting my sword to meet her flesh, she simply blinks out of existence, reappearing a few feet further away.*
>
>*"Oooh, so forceful! You must be pent up beyond compare, great hero! I bet with all the demons, sorcerers, dark knights and more that need slaying, you must not have had a lot of time for laying, eh?" Again, she cackles, way too pleased at her own joke. "C'mon now, Rich—I can call you Rich, right?—I know a guy that hasn't fucked in months when I see one. Is it really worth it, doing all this for some goddess with tits like mountains that never puts out?"*
>
>*Another stab from my end, and another teleport from her. "Do not besmirch the great name of Taris with your vile demonic language, Pitchtail! I will cut you down where you stand!" I yell, even though I can't help but feel like there's something wrong here. This shouldn't be this difficult.*
>
>*The demon queen's haughty behavior only intensifies with her amusement at my struggle. "Oh, what's this? Can't thrust like you used to, Rich? I don't think you'll be needing that sharp thing anymore, you'l just hurt yourself. Let me deal with that." And then, with a swift move of her hand, my sword flies out of my hand and straight out a window. While I cannot see my own face, the expression on it must now be one of total shock. This wasn't supposed to happen! Isn't this exactly what Taris protected me against?*
>
>*Again, she cackles, even louder this time. "Awww... did I take your toy away? If only your goddess had protected you against demon women like me! Oh wait... I'm not a demon woman. If only your useless goddess was able to cast more general spells, you wouldn't be surprised when a demon boy shows up!"*

When you set out to defeat the evil demon queen with protection from the goddess that prevents you from falling prey to seduction from demonic women, you didn't expect the specific wording of the spell to be an issue. Turns out, you expected wrong.

>*I tried to ignore her seductive looks, but my mind kept returning to the countess' ample chest. Though, a question came to mind, one I had to ask. "Why would you need my help anyway? You're a powerful vampire. What do you need a human hunter for?"*
>
>*Anastasia's eyes flashed red, and she leaned closer to me. "I am not all powerful yet. Many others seek my head, more than I can deal with. Attacking them myself would draw too much attention, but a vampire hunter doing so? No one will suspect a thing. Now, what do you say, little hunter? Will you join me?"*
>
>*Anastasia's words were sweet, but her eyes gave her true intentions away. She wanted me to work for her, but only because she knew I wouldn't be able to resist her charms. That's why she made the offer. And even though I wasn't stupid enough to fall for her flattery, I still had to consider my options. If I refused, I'm dead. If I joined her, maybe I could survive.*
>
>*"What kind of terms do you have in mind?" I asked, hoping to find a way out of this mess.*

(You) are a vampire hunter who gets caught by a vampire.

>*Today these emotions had come to a climax; Albedo-sama changed my voice to perfectly mimic that of Ainz. To test how true to the original my voice sounded I simply said her name, and told her she did a good job. I figured it was a simple enough thing. And it was, it made her happy. Too happy. Nobody could have expected how her joyous face twisted into a mask of mad ecstasy. Her arousal at hearing a perfect copy of Master Ainz's voice echoing from my skeletal maw seemed to have triggered something inside her. She was panting as she looked me up and down, her long tongue darting out to languidly lash across her lush lips, her entire body vibrating with excitement.*

Be Albedo's toy. Things can get pretty weird, but it's fun; at least to me.

>
>*She simply laughs as much as she can as her airways begin to constrict. She says as mockingly as she can, "Then do it. But don't expect to see your beloved Delilah again if you do."*
>
>*"What?!" You exclaim in surprise.*
>
>*Her eyes widen in amusement as she continues, "Oh, did you really think she was dead? That was one of my sloppiest fake deaths and you fell for it so easily. I suppose love does cloud one's judgment She's still alive, he-ro."*
>
>*Your heart sinks and you let go of her neck. As she tries to pull away, you grab her and slam her back down against the concrete floor. You lean down close to her face and glare into her eyes. "Where is she?!"*
>
>*She seems to enjoy the fear in your eyes as she answers, "Don't worry, He-ro. She's closer than you think."*
>
>*"Tell me!" You demand.*
>
>*She looks up at you with pity in her eyes. "Do you really want to know? Could you handle the heartbreak?"*
>
>*You are a bit disturbed by how genuine her normally monstrous voice is starting to sound.*
>
>*"I'll give you a hint. It's a place you would never think to look." She coos with a knowing smirk.*

Capturing your nemesis was supposed to be something worth celebrating. It wasn't.

>*Only hours later, Lady Bai shivered with perverse anticipation as the eunuch guards lead her through the emperor's personal, walled, harem-complex. She had resumed her human disguise, but could barely disguise her leering, predatory gaze, which made the normally respected concubines shiver in fear as she passed. As she passed through the ornate grounds, she wordlessly gestured for the guards to gather women of her choosing, one after another, until the eunuchs were leading a congregation of four scared concubines, who wordlessly followed their directions in submissive grace. She had the guards lead the four, increasingly scared young women up to her new quarters in the harem complex. She beamed inwardly with pride, as she saw the imperial porters bringing expensive lacquered furniture and other lavish trappings to her room, at Huang's bidding. As the eunuch guards lined the four concubines up in her room, Lady Bai flippantly dismissed the porters and guards with a wave, as the four women jumped as the large, wooden doors to her room shut firmly behind the last departing guard.*
>
>*The witch shuddered with excitement, as she wordlessly marched back and fourth in front of the gathered concubines, who kept their almond-shaped eyes downcast as they waited for her to break the silence, "You women shall call me Lady Bai. Considering how incredibly intimate we are all about to become, I think it's best if I dropped any pretenses about myself, or my intentions towards you all." said smugly, as she dismissed her enchanted disguised, and assumed her true-form as a snake-woman.*

Emperor Huang, first to unify China as a single empire, fears death. He has posted notices across the four corners of ancient China, calling for all who know of ways to extend life to visit his court and share their methods for Imperial boons. Two mystical, semi-spirit animal creatures that have long been at odds, the turtle Fahai and white serpent Bai Suzhen, sense an opportunity to curry favor with the powerful monarch, and set out to impress him. However, it is the girl-hungry snake witch Bai, with her promises of the life-extending effects of mercury, that earns Huang's imperial seal of approval.

>*A smile creeps into his expression, and it's not a welcoming, warm one. It's a vicious, cold one, like a predator that is about to toy with its prey. "Alright, Jack, welcome to your new job. Here's how this is going to go: When I speak, you listen. When I command, you follow. And above all... you don't blab to anybody. If what you've seen here today gets out in any way, I will make sure you regret it for every last minute of what will be the very short remainder of your miserable existence, got it?" A wordless nod is all I can muster as a response, and with another one of those creepy chuckles, he takes a step away, giving me a better look at his entire figure in that dress. "I know you like how I look. Of course you do, I'm the best looking god damn thing your perverted eyes have ever been able to witness. And guess what... you're going to fuck this beautiful thing, right now."*

A life spiraling out of control and increasing amounts of debt lead to you being drafted into the mob in order to repay it. However, you did not expect that you would end up being one of the people told to guard the boss's son. And when you stumble into his room and see something you shouldn't, your job is about to become a lot more... intimate.

The giggling returned. Thankful for the torch's light a figure approached. Long, slender legs and a traditional robe walked into the light, revealing a beautiful young woman with the widest, most self-satisfied smirk Richard had ever seen. The brilliance of her eyes were so distracting it took a few moments longer for Richard to notice the woman's head bore the ears of a fox, and a long, bushy paint-brushy tail was swaying behind her.*
>
>*"You've such a heart of gold, dear Ranger," the fox woman said, greeting Richard, who was still standing by the snowed in entrance of the cave by way of a courtsey, "My name is Mirai and you will be my plaything. Oh, and worry not about the dame you thought was chased into this cavern by a ferocious beast. That was I. Come now. Enter my cavern proper so that we may speak."*

You only had good intentions. Instead, your good Karma only lead you astray, straight into the clutches of a feisty Kitsune; during winter no less! Check easy mode for easy snusnu.

>*The simple farmer man could scarcely believe what he was seeing, as a grey-skinned alien with huge, black, almond-shaped eyes strode through the swirling fog and approached the slab he was immobilized against. The creature's body was far thinner than a humans and showed no trace of hair or muscles, a thin, foil-like alloy material covering the creature's Lanky body below the neck. It had a small, narrow mouth, and no ears, chin, nose besides two nostril slits, or other distinct facial features on its perfect, smooth grey face. His mind was a chaotic flurry as he gazed at the alien creature calmly approaching him. He became even more confused, as the alien grey communicated wordlessly with him, its shrill, feminine voice telepathically ringing through his head, \<Do not worry human, I do not intend to harm you. My people require something incredibly precious from you; we need your seed. Do not bother trying to verbally communicate, I can read your mind.\> As soon as the alien mentioned that it could read his mind, Edgar's thoughts spontaneously raced through every terrible deed or dirty thought he had ever conceived of, as the terrified yokel tried to steady and organize his thoughts as the alien released a strange "Ack-ack-ack-ack!" sound at his distressed, guilty thoughts, and he realized it was laughing at him.*

Edgar Cletus is a secluded Montana flax farmer, content to continue his life of self-imposed isolation, until an other-worldly being abducts him from his beat-up pick-up truck, and takes the naive farmer incredibly far outside of his comfort zone. This strange interplanetary interloper seems to be interested in stealing his precious seed and his long guarded V card, using the primitive Earth man to satisfy her/its own debasement kinks.

>*Our family has made its wealth off of the slave trade. There once was a time when a slave from the Servitos family would have been worth a small fortune, known for their obedience and good pedigree. However, the family business has dwindled over the years. My uncle was the last one in the family actively training slaves. I had not considered taking up the trade until I saw on paper just all that would receive in inheritance. My uncle's estate is on the edge of the city of Gratia and has been in the family for generations. The manor is equipped with everything someone would need to keep and train slaves. The more I thought about it, the more interesting the idea had become. The life of your typical aristocrat was starting to become drab to me and there was something romantic about the idea of rejuvenating the family business. So I decided to do just that. I sold off some of my remaining assets and packed my things.*

You are the descendant of a famous slaver family in a Victorian fantasy world. Your family has slowly moved away from slaving and your uncle was the last. Now that he has passed he has left his estate in the city of Gratia to you.

>*But before he could condemn me to death like a common criminal, that woman interrupted him. A quick whisper into his ear, a soft sadness around her eyes. Amelia Sternenbund. Did she believe I wished for her pity, that whore? And she is so close to him. Just watching that made me wish to rush at her and claw at her eyes—it wrenched my heart. Surely the guards would cut me down on the spot before I could even scramble to my feet, so all I could do is wait for my beloved to pronounce my sentence. His eyes widened and he continued to speak.*

You are Lady Anthesia von Eisenburgen, the betrothed of Prince Lichterstahl. Well, that would be ex-betrothed, because despite your relentless efforts in bullying her out of the academy, that filthy peasant thieving cat who always plays the goody two shoes has stolen him away from you and now even your final—very final, if it had succeeded—plan against her has been revealed.

>
>*Although having realized that this stranger possessed a personal grudge against her, the old woman was not yet deterred in her attempts at pleading for her life and well-being. "I meant no harm to you!," claimed she, despite not having the first clue of what the young hero meant, and continuing to cling at the wound, hoping in vain for a miraculous miracle of the gods themselves. "Pity my plight! My p-plea for clemency! If you desire, I shall reform my vile and wicked ways! Yes, yes! No longer will my minions ravish, plunder, and pillage in the streets and villages of human land! So, prithee! Spare this elderly devil of her life, young sir!" cried out the wicked, red demon as she begged the man who bested her in battle in the middle of her castle itself.*

>*The oil chandeliers overhead shined their flickering candlelight against the dark marble floors of the grand castle's great hall. "Then, become mine, you wicked witch," the blond human commanded. "You took something precious away from me, so you shall now pay by providing another. Become my mother, or you will perish."*
>
>*"W… What?"*

After a long war with the monsters, the young, orphaned Vautur saved humanity by defeating the wicked Devil Queen once and for all, the same woman responsible for his mother's death. But, it turned out the young human had other plans for the likes of the ageing, elderly queen of all monsters…

>*The blue spandex-clad man sauntered up to her raised dais, arms imposingly crossed over his chest, as he regarded her with an affable nod, his outrageous, bulging muscles rippling under his tight, flamboyant garb. "Madam Silvarpaw, I see your addiction to rare art and exotic cosmetics has left your criminal empire destitute again! Robbing banks? Doesn't that seem a bit below a villainess of your caliber?" he said condescendingly, a smirk revealing his blinding-white teeth. The fox woman was incredibly tired of this man's shit, as she struggled to maintain her composure in the face of this looming clash.*
>
>*"You've fallen right into my trap, Nipple-man, but even your accursed powers won't deliver you from your final fate at my furious cla-- fangs!" the kimono-clad super villain shrieked down at him, trying to sound confident. "Animal-Squad, attack!" she declared triumphantly, as she pressed the secret button that activated her under-foot henchman deployment platforms to emerge from trapdoors in the floor. Her vulpine face dropped in panic, as she realized her platforms had only produced three, scared-looking minions that visibly trembled before the legendary Nipple-man.*

Madam Silverpaw is an ingenuous kitsune villainess brought to desperate measures, as she uses her technological marvels to rob a local bank. Her heist is quickly thwarted, however, by a masked vigilante keen on ensuring Justice is swiftly served for the felonious fox lady.

>*Professionalism meant that Vera had to compartmentalize her thoughts and emotions whenever dealing with clients. Still, it was nigh impossible to ignore the chasm between the bickering couple; one was stern and regal, while the other was friendly and modest. Experience taught her that opposites attract, and so she could guess at the source of their argument by listening to their conversation, even if she had to force herself to keep a straight face.*
>
>*Vera let out a sigh to clear away the tension in the air. "Do you feel comfortable sharing details now?"*
>
>*"Yes." Mara placed her palms together and rested them on her lap. "But first, I should admit to my real identity."*
>
>*"Please do." Vera pulled a chair over near the couch for the husband, but Joachim motioned for her to take it instead, choosing to remain standing.*
>
>*After a brief pause, Mara spoke again, "I am Death incarnate, in human form." Her voice sounded confident and unwavering, betraying none of the nerves that came with such a confession.*

>*An unsurprising shiver ran down her spine. "You’re kidding."*

>
>*The creature's nature was not lost upon me, a crimson glow filling her cheeks and pupils dilating until they were little more than pinpricks. "You know what I want." The white, gossamer gown that clung to the pint-sized butcher teased her prepubescent form; horns the color of coagulated gore poked past her brow.*
>
>*"Please," my voice was barely a croak, "I can't take anymore..."*
>
>*The pitiful display coaxed a wicked laugh from the Redcap, a sound like the tinkling of broken glass. "What's the matter? Scared?" She stepped closer, the hem of her dress dragging across the wet grass. "You know," a tiny foot flashed forward, pale toes pressing into the softness of my crotch, "you'd make a pretty good husband...or a nice, stiff piece of meat."*

>*But before the mercenaries could deploy the final part of their non-lethal immobilization equipment, the dark xenomorph reared up, pulling with its incredible strength against its chemical bonds. The beast shrieked an inhuman yowl, as it ripped itself forward with frenzied motions, the struggle cracking the creature's carapace in places, as its bright-green blood spilled out, and filled the room with an acidic scent. The blood sizzled as it encountered the restraining glue, and dissolved it away, as the creature charged his squad before they could even start switching to their pulse-rifles. John felt distant and numb to the carnage that surrounded him, as he dispassionately watched the creature's long, spinal, jointed tail sweep across the soldiers, the bladed tip bisecting several men in one arc. He felt more warm than afraid or disgusted, as he was drenched in blood from the carnage, as he slipped on the cave-floor and hit his head hard. John decided to rest on the cool cave floor for a moment, as he barely noticed a huge shadow looming over him. His intoxicated vision was rendered even blurrier by the hard fall, and he had trouble making out the alien's eyeless, snarling maw as it slowly lowered over his face. Entranced by the strange situation, he tenderly reached out and grasped at the side of the huge alien xenomorph's long, thick, tapering head. The creature's saliva dripped over his face, as he marveled at it's imposing, metallic-hued fangs, as his consciousness faded.*

>*"Hmm, so I was right, you smell like a boy... W-what is the meaning... of this..." she said, gesturing at his manhood, a strange emotion over-taking the powerful, predatory fox deity's face, her eight tails swishing around the air in agitation. The shame-faced youth got on his knees before the stormy-tempered master of his village, hoping beyond hope that he could somehow salvage the terrible insult, as he breathlessly explained "I.. even though I'm a boy I can't do any physical work.. I'm useless! But because I look like... this... they told me I could replace a girl, when the time for your offering came, so..." he trailed off weakly, as he stared dumb-struck at Kyuubi-sama.*
>
>*He realized, awkwardly, that Kyuubi-sama was weeping as she intently listened to his story, regarding him with a piercing, emotional stare as she daintily dabbed away at the corners of her teary-eyes with a silken-handkerchief.*

The desperate elders of a fox-people village are forced to make a hard choice. Their patron guardian deity, a magically powerful nine-tailed kitsune, requires regular sacrificial, ceremonial offerings of the village's best young women. Reluctant to continue relinquishing their prized daughters, they offer up instead a hapless, effeminate orphaned male youth to sate the predatory fox-spirits need for live, sentient flesh. But instead, the dominating guardian deity finds comradely, intimacy, and perhaps a sense of decency in the embrace of her new, inexperienced paramour.

Inhabit my body, eat your fill, and grant me the bounty I seeeeeeeeeeeeak!" Agatha rasped out, the last word drawing from her throat like a death-rattle, as the witch's antique muscles twitched and writhed unnaturally, as she felt a grim presence enter her, her entire body buzzing as if covered in flies, until the disturbing sensation seemed to internalize and fill her blood. Slowly, Agatha could feel an incredible hunger enter her body, a hunger unlike any other.*
>
>*Somehow, the witch knew, she could not feed this hunger with her mouth, oh no, this particular demon preferred inhabiting a different part of the witch's female anatomy. "Hope, oh dear sweet hope. Could you show your old, Auntie Agatha what it means, to be a good wife to your future husband? Come close dear, don't be ashamed..." the witch said, as she raised her robe high, revealing her hairy snatch, which twitched and wriggled unnaturally as she approached the submissively kneeling elf. Hope barely regarded the strange scene, as the witch woman's snarling snatch closely approached her placid, serene face, Agatha excitedly yelling out "Come on dearie! Give Auntie a big wet kiss!" as she spread her legs over Hope's sweet, innocent face.*

"Your own soul? You wish to forfeit your existence for one night of passion with a demon of your own summoning?" she asked incredulously.*

>*"Not enough? Not enough, little human? The society you live in must value their own lives very little if you think your own soul is such a tiny wager," she said, the amusement draining form her voice with every word as she leaned down, cupping your face with both hands, the glow of her eyes intensifying, "But no matter. You've offered your soul as the payment to lay with me; and it is with the utmost pleasure - for myself at the very least - that I accept your generous offer, dear human. With this our pact is sealed."*

You've made the virgin mistake of summoning a succubus and instantly offering all of your soul for one single otherworldly romp.

Dropping the ring in the pool, I start rubbing her dorsal fin in an attempt to calm her down and get her to regain her composure. "It's okay Cindy," I reassure her, "I'm just trying to help you concentrate, so we can show them how amazing you are!" I rub her fin some more, feeling her smooth, rubbery flesh, and after a while, she snaps out of her trance.*

>*"Alright, sorry folks!", I announce to the crowd, "It Looks like Cindy just needed a little motivation to perform for you all today!" I hold up the ring again and look back over, only to see the dolphin with her belly in the air. Her large, muscular tail is thrashing against the water, almost beckoning me to come closer. Worst of all, looking down at her nether regions, I can see that her slit is engorged, completely swollen, and dripping with anticipation for something.*

She's rubbing furiously back and forth against it, trying to scratch an itch or something. Her eyes are completely glazed over and she's completely lost in the moment as her whole body writhes and twitches, her tail swishing from side to side haphazardly. As I whistle to get her attention, she suddenly stops and turns around to look at me. The look on her face says everything, something is clearly bothering her, and that's not normal for Cappuccino.*
>
>*Walking up to her, I start to pat her on the back to cool her off, the mud covering her smearing into my hand, but it only seems to excite her further. With a loud whinny, she starts trembling under my touch, her tail whipping back and forth even faster now, splattering dirt across jacket. She seems much warmer than usual, and I can only notice how damp her coat is, her sweat dripping onto the ground beneath us in a muddy mixture. Oh god, I hope this doesn't mean what I think it means...*

The venom has sapped my strength to the point where all I can do is watch as she turns around and spots me, her antennae waving chaotically around as the group approaches me. My heart races as the kalphites then start to sniff at my armour, gently poking and prodding it with their huge mandibles. Still dazed from the venomous bite, I find myself frozen in place as this strange situation plays out before me. Slowly, one by one, my armour is removed by the kalphite queen's guardians, until I'm left in nothing but my leather breeches and boots. As I stand there naked before them, they stop moving and sit motionless, waiting for further instructions from their queen.*

I snapped back to reality and tried to focus on getting dinner ready. "Okay, let me finish up," I said, turning away from her. I prepared a few more things for dinner with her hanging onto my arm and then we went to sit on the couch together.*

>*Skye laid herself across my lap and looked up at me. I always knew she was a cutie, but I hadn't realized how beautiful she had become until now. She wore a simple blue skirt, and her blouse was unbuttoned partway down, revealing her cleavage. I couldn't help but stare at her chest. What's going on with me today, I wondered. I felt so strange.*

>*She looked up at me adoringly and I recalled her symptoms: feeling hot, unable to get comfortable, excessively clingy and affectionate... All symptoms of a dog-girl in heat, but there was no way that could be true, right?*

Kuku started drooling at the thought of it, her hungry serpent stomach rumbling, as she fidgeted and slithered around in her bed. Zola finally came to the doorway, her expression grim and solemn as she bowed deeply before the living sacred idol of her god. After performing the necessary oblations before the deified serpent, Zola spoke in her deep, husky voice "The sacrificial offerings await outside your chambers"*

A gluttonous serpent honored as a living embodiment of a god is offered a seemingly endless parade of pious young women to feast on. Her priestly manager, Zola, has grown numb from seeing the boisterous, growing serpent consume countless live women, and has prepared a special feast of loyal young female acolytes, oiled for the feathered snake's enjoyment. Most promising of all, is the slimy, brightly-colored frog girl that has been proffered for Kuku's enjoyment; little does the snake deity know, but this special treat's skin is intensely hallucinogenic!

It smelled faintly like earth and wet rock. She rubbed her face against it, feeling its rough texture against her scales.*

She stayed on the ground, head bowed and staring down at the polished stone, unable to lift her eyes until she heard pawsteps coming towards her.*

>*"...You drank some, didn't you?" Klyiarna growled, stepping close to her. Rilka could feel the warmth of the dragoness' breath against her face, and... was that drool pattering against the floor? Was the royal actually slobbering at her? No... that couldn't be right.*
>
>*The alchemist raised her eyes and looked at the monarch's muzzle, then up at her, her pupils widening with terror as the queen loomed even closer. She reached for the collar of Rilka's dress and tore open the front, revealing the vial hidden there. "Hrrrr... Naughty girl, you've derailed all my plans for you tonight..." The queen snarled, then snapped up the bottle in her talons. "Do you realize how distracting you're being, swanning around, practically glowing with allure?"*

>*Peter had noticed his griffon taking a particular liking to 'punishing' the female reprobates by swallowing them whole and alive, earning her a fearsome reputation among the female criminal class in the city. Peter almost found it chilling how much Zara seemed to enjoy and indulge in the squirming resistance of her live female prey, as they were sent wriggling down her beak, into her wide griffon gullet, down into her tight, stretchy stomach, which was covered in soft tan fur. Peter had come to learn with grim disgust, that many of the women Zara swallowed could last for days in the griffons slowly churning gut, before her weak stomach acids would finish digesting them to death. Truly a grim fate, but Peter rationalized that justice must be served.*

A brave knight and his fearsome griffon stead become the hapless arbiters of cruel justice in a kingdom dependent on draconian punishments to enforce their corrupt rule of law. Four young women are sentenced to an unspeakable end, for the simple crime of selling their bodies on the streets. Prostitution without a license being a capitol offense in Devo, due to the corrupt ruling council's eagerness to force more women into their many abusive brothel establishments. Note for continuing the story: Several days after dispensing justice, a desperate farmer approaches Peter. The impoverished dunkard of a farmer cannot afford to feed his many, many daughters or pay their dowries, and hates the thought of sending them to the whorehouses, so he requests the knight give several of his older girls a 'dignified' end in Zara's belly.

>*Still, the shock of it all has me falling into silence for a while, simply brushing my horse without responding. But since I don't protest, he simply continues. "If push comes to shove, you would be taking over as duke, my liege. As his only descendant, you have a clear claim and no rival claimants. And that is why I have taken an interest in you recently—I had to confirm for myself that you would be a good ruler. Thankfully, my instincts about you were correct." With a smile on his face, he walks over to me and starts petting my horse. "How someone treats animals can tell you a lot about a person, and everything you've shown me tells me that you are kind-hearted and caring. You do not deign yourself above caring for an animal, even though a noble of your station would always have the servants take care of it. Even though I told you to do it, you never complained or resisted in any way, and your horse is repaying you for it. I can tell he likes you a lot, and trusts you. And I trust you as well, my liege. So if we were to put our plan into action... would you support us?"*

>*All I can do is nod as I finish up the brushing. Turning to face Anders, his face lights up. "I knew I could believe in you. But now that we've talked about my secret, how about we talk about your secret?" he then says, and my heart skips a beat.*

As the prince and sole heir of a small duchy, you have spent your life so far in luxury, isolated from the political intrigues of the realm. But on one of the riding lessons, your tutor, the marshal of the duchy, reveals some troubling news of discontent at court and requests your assistance if things should escalate. And then, he also reveals that he knows a few... intimate details about you.

Behind here stood two other cat people, a redheaded female cat dressed in a maid outfit and a male cat with round ears in what you could only describe as a butler's uniform. The crook-eared cat stood off to the side, seemingly embarrassed about having tripped you on your entry.*

There was only a couch and a bed shaped out of the stone the room is made of, so you decided to inspect the waterway. You could see a small black shape in the distance approaching you. Your succu-girl was part aquatic lizard, you could tell that much. But what would she be? The excitement had you panting.*
>
>*Your succu-girl's arrival, however, had you screaming like a girl. Instead of a small, slender amphibian slowly slipping out of the sloshing waters a behemoth of a succu-girl jumped out, announcing herself as Nilea as she wrapped you in an embrace that swept you off your feet. She stood as tall as you'd imagine a minotaur might. She had the head of a gator, snout and all a torso shaped like that of a well built amazon woman and a tail as long as your body.*
>
>*"It is not often one of your kind seeks the services of a queen of the Nile, such as myself," Nilea cooed, her voice dominant and sappy. Her body was still dripping with water, her muscles glistening in the dim light of the cavern. A low rumble sounded from her throat as she turned her head to inspect you up close with one eye.*

>*"No," I gasped under my breath, but in her presence this fate seemed assured.*

>*"But it is not fun to simply take you, no," Kali's low growl becoming a deep purr. "I wish to hunt; to chase. So run! Run my little morsel. For once I have my way with you, I shall kill you."*

>*Kali stepped away from me, reclining nearby in the dream's landscape. She stared at me, never blinking, as I stood there, too stunned to act.*

>*Kason takes a moment to reflect on his own life, wondering if he's made the right decision to raise a dragon, as he sits down to his meal. Kason suddenly hears a feminine voice in his head, as he feels a presence slide up next to him, as he realizes Kim has stealthily made her way into the tavern while invisible. "Wow, what do you think of that maid?" Kim's cheerful voice rang out into Kason's mind, as the dragoness sat down besides her paladin.*
>
>*"I know you haven't eaten in a while Kim, but I'm not sure about this. We should probably keep a low profile, so no one else notices us. Someone might miss her." Kason replied in his thoughts, as he felt Kim's slimy bifurcated tongue lick at his ear playfully.*
>
>*"Oh, come on! What harm could a quick snack do, you really think anyone's going to notice she's gone before we are? You get to enjoy a nice warm meal, why not me? Besides, I've been craving some meat for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to eat something tasty!" Kim teased.*

Kason is an earnest, but overwhelmed paladin, blatantly faltering in his charge of leading his life-long dragon ward, Kim, towards the path of Good. Despite years of moralizing and preaching at the playful young dragoness, she has leaned into her predatory nature and wantonly consumes numerous sentient women across the lands of Mendes. Following along her parental paladin guardian, often invisible, Kim does as she pleases as Kason battles the forces of evil and tries to steer her back towards a humane path. Remember, the dragoness can turn invisible, but the prey inside her stomach cannot! Possible plot elements to include later in the story: Kason feels bad about Kim's prey, and tries to use healing magic and buffs to alleviate their discomfort, but only makes things worse. Kim uses good vs evil battle language as innuendo to goad the paladin into illicit love-making.

>*The small gnome, garbed in a heap of stinking, recycled rags and old-animal skins, sauntered out to the center of the glen and awaited the approaching war-party. As the tall, muscular Amazonian shield-maidens approached with characteristic zeal, wantonly trampling his herbal gardens, the gnome smirked smugly to himself, realizing they were dooming themselves as the hulking sergeant of the female troop called out to the small druid "Foul little stink-worm! I have come to face you in single battle like a woman! Face me if you dare, or be cut down like the animal you are!" though her bellowing words were mighty, Shamus could already see an unsteady, sluggish tilt spreading across the well-armed squad, as the women began rubbing their increasingly sore, stiff muscles. A look of concern spread over the sergeant's face, as she called out "What foul devilry is---Hhyuurk!" her sentence was cut-off mid-word, as he jaw muscles seized and stiffened, the twelve or so women coming to an awkward halt as they simply froze in place, their impressive muscular bodies twitching and seizing as the paralytic plant venom kept them motionless. Several of the troop fell down, still frozen in awkward poses on the ground, as a gentle rustling in the tall glen grass could be heard, as something slithered nearby the incapacitated warrior women.*
>
>*Shamus strode up to the stilled sergeant, calmly saying as he stroked his matted, gray beard "You women from your 'mighty' civilization think you have grown beyond the power of nature, that your farms and walls and dams can thwart and tame the elements, that you have become the absolute masters of all you see, but this is a grave error in thought. We are all a part of nature, a part of the cycle of life, and you haughty despoilers will soon find out exactly where you women rank on this forest's food-chain." with his speech over, the small druid let out a loud hissing sound, eliciting a louder rustling from the surrounding brush. The last remaining mobile part of the paralyzed Amazonian warrior women, their eyes, all swiveled to the mighty sight of a rearing anaconda, much larger than any snake normally should be, as its long, bifurcated tongue flicked at the air, tasting the scent of the women's sweat and fear.*

A gnome druid renounces civilization and finds peace in the natural world, until a militant nation of Amazonian warrior women sees his forest as the perfect patch of land to exploit for their burgeoning war-machine. The druid desperately tries to fend off this advanced, superior foe, using guerilla warfare, the forest's might, and his hungry anaconda animal companion, which has defeated many burly harridans with its expansive stomach. Use Shamus's powers to call animals, enchanted plants, and other natural allies to defeat the invading forces of civilization.

>*I'm really excited about arriving. I was happy to hear someone was interested in my work, I was starting to have trouble getting a job. Plus city life in the city has become repetitive and unfulfilling. Spending some time on a nearly private beach for a few months will be the perfect break. Then the light started to peer out of the darkness and the train had finally passed through the tunnel. Looking out the window again I saw the beautiful stretch of nature leading out towards the beach. From atop the hill, I can see a river flowing from the forest through the plains and out into the ocean. In the open area, there are a few buildings along a small road that must be the town. The train starts to slow as it approaches and I see the small platform that is the town's train station.*

Steam rose up from the murky canals that infested and overflowed through the city, giving the place a febrile atmosphere. The deep hum of industrial machinery and the chaotic clangor of revelry and rough-housing filled the air. Big black eyes stared up at the encroaching fog—the eyes of a wandering opossum waif named Guzzle. Her fur was sooty, matted and filthy; she was a skinny creature, haggard and ragged, clad in a tattered sweater that hung loose about her shoulders. Hopping over a pile of broken bricks, she gazed blankly at the dim light of a leaning lamppost and clutched at the knife hidden beneath her sweater. "I'm 'ungry," the emaciated opossum muttered, licking her dry black lips. "Need to find somefin' to eat."*

The cosmopolitan crowds are often fascinated, and even sickened, by the sight of hapless women being slowly dragged into the slimy maws of creatures capable of stuffing countless writhing female feeding slaves into their stretchy stomachs. Some of the zoo's predatory creatures are so tame, visitors are allowed to walk up and pet their bloated stomachs. Some enjoy to marvel at the sight, feeling, and sound of the poor girls writhing in their dominating predator's stomach, enduring a lengthy digestion process as zoo patrons gawk at their consumer's bloated bellies and line up for photos. A particularly skilled and experienced tour guide is leading a group of excited tourists along the most popular zoo attractions the facility has to offer, during feeding time for the animals.*

A capricious, callously operated zoo capitalizes on easy to acquire, but hard to care-for voracious alien beasts, by putting on grisly live-feeding shows for their morbid audience of high-paying spectators. A skilled tour-guide leads a gaggle of gawking tourists along to observe the zoo's infamous live animal feeding shows.

>*From Piddler's back, the goblin wildling had delivered swift justice to many unsuspecting elven archers with his rusty dirk. Piddler could pad along so softly on his big furry paws, that even an elf's long ears often failed to detect the mounted beast prowling up from behind. Snignag had perfected the art of catching lone elves with Piddler, the dynamic duo sneaking up on, then startling their elf enemies during the crucial moments of ambush with a mighty howl and shrieking goblin war-cry. There was nothing the measly green goblin loved more, than laying haughty elven warrior low, and subjecting them to Piddler's more bestial inclinations, as well as Snignag's randy, wanton goblin sex-drive.*

A small, malformed green creature happens upon the abandoned runt of a ferocious canine predator species, and a life-long friendship is born. Snigsnag the goblin rides Piddler the dire wolf like a knight riding a mighty steed, and in Quixotic grandeur, hunts the elves that have mercilessly tried to exterminate his diminutive species for centuries. His wolf is more concerned with getting his knot pleasured, and his belly filled, than Snigsnag is obsessed with mocking and degrading whatever hapless elf he can get in his stubby-green clutches, or under Piddler's mighty, furry paws.

It featured Yancy heaving the gigantic octopus Matt had observed earlier, which gripped around the old man securely with all eight appendages as he teetered and tottered under its weight, before awkwardly chucking it into a nearby floor-pool. Yancy motioned for him to look at a door which opened straight to the pool, as a dark-skinned Asian woman strode in, immediately falling into the water below, with the giant octopus. Matt's heart started racing at what he saw, as he realized the footage looked genuine, as he watched the octopus wrap it's slimy tentacles over her thrashing body in the turbulent water. "Keep watching, darn thing's been debeaked apparently, so it puts on quite a show..." the old man mused, as Matt sat transfixed, watching the grizzly footage.*

Matt is a financially strapped college student that hears about a lucrative job opportunity in a college town that doesn't have much work to offer. The awkward freshman walks to the obscure location in his Sunday best, to try to land his first big job, only to be greeted by a huge, sprawling, dilapidated concrete compound, ominously titled 'Yancy Randall's Exotic Pets! (Tours by appointment only)'. Matt quickly discovers that the old man's shop is the end-of-the-line for a bio-engineering lab's many freakishly enlarged, woman-hungry mutant animals, as he is featured to a graphic depiction of what his new duties keeping the many pet animals 'fed' entails.

>*"You know," Seraph mused, her silvery eyes settling upon mine, "you should really relax more often." We paused at the copying room before entering, my witchy companion pressing the creases of her dark, pencil dress. "It's good for you."*
>
>*"'Relax'," I guffawed, "Please enlighten me, Seraph, what constitutes 'relaxation' in this office?"*
>
>*She laughed. "I'm just saying, you're not getting any younger, and you don't look like you've been sleeping well lately."*

>*"Oh, I sleep fine," I lied.*

>*Upper-management had magically sealed me inside of the office a few years back; a handful supervisors complaining that I wasn't there to provide a fresh shot of spunk to their morning cup of joe. Escape was impossible, and I'd consented to being their on-demand fucktoy with drab resignation, "Just can't get enough of my work, I guess."*

Hired on as a mailroom associate, the witches of SalemSales see you as their perfect little cum-bag. What's a guy to do but resign himself to his fate? Perhaps the opportunity to escape may arise? Probably not.

>
>*"They're donuts, Cordelia." My eyes were half-open, a thermos of coffee glued to my lips; I had no time for the dark elf's peculiarities and reached around to retrieve a syrupy, golden bun.*
>
>*My lack of outrage to her plight, or apologetic groveling at minimum, made the neurotic gal nearly pop a gasket, "My point exactly! Your world's artificially-sweetened confectionaries are - vile, insidious creations! My superior metabolism cannot adequately digest these alchemical abominations!" A small piece of sugary pastry fell from Cordelia's lips as she ranted on about their nutritional content.*
>
>*"Wait, are you eating one?" I asked incredulously, tilting my head to the side.*
>
>*Exposed, wide-eyed, mouth agape, Cordelia shrieked, "What? N-No, I am not!"*

Long after the merging of our worlds, Dark Elf Cordelia and I come to a peculiar crossroads as her addiction to sugary sweets compels her to make a most scandalous proposition.

>*"So, uh, are you gonna come out with me tonight?" I asked, hoping to get her mind off whatever it was.*
>
>*"I'm heading home after I get my stuff; maybe later, dude." It was as if every word was some effort to her, oozing angst.*
>
>*My gut churned, "You're not going to tell me why?"*
>
>*She shook her head, "No, I've had my fill." We'd arrived at her desk. Lo and behold, her personals were scattered across its top; the air hung thick with one-sided tension. Even as I looked to her eyes to find some inkling of vulnerability, Raika averted her gaze.*
>
>*"Ok, cool. Well, see ya tomorrow then." My tone was curt, I could feel myself getting angry. She might be upset, but I couldn't let this go unchallenged.*
>
>*"Maybe."*
>
>*There was a long pause. Even as Raika held her door keys, neither of us budged. In my peripheral vision, I watched her chest rise and fall with each breath. Then, finally, she turned to me, the weight of her stare heavy. Her lips parted slightly, she stared down at me, eyes pleading.*
>
>*She looked frozen, so I started with an awkward affirmation, "You can tell me anything, you know. So if something is bothering you–"*
>
>*"Can I?" she cut in, interrupting me. The last thing I expected was such sharpness from an easygoing friend, but I was willing to give her space to vent. With a sigh, she said, "You don't even see me, do you? After all this time." Raika's voice was a whisper, as if she was talking through me; she shook her head in shameful disbelief.*

>*Authority and submission went a long way between us, so the message was immediately received. Maddy nuzzled her ebony locks into my neckline as we hugged to seal her apology, "Ok, 'Daddy', I won't do it again." The glaring size difference between us was apparent when we embraced; a whiff of Maddy's natural smell exciting the part of me I generally kept subdued in public.*
>
>*For 2 years, I'd trained Madeline to masquerade as my daughter, a deep rooted obedience ingrained into her psyche by rigorous Pavlovian conditioning. "Can I fix it so you aren't upset?" Such an innocent question laced with deviant implication.*
>
>*Just bringing my little plaything to work had been a burst of exhilaration, the danger of being outed only strengthening my lust; why did voyeurism excite me so? I looked around to make sure no one was lingering in the immediate vicinity of my desk; it was clear.*
>
>*"I'm not upset, silly goose, but you can help me." Maddy's silken locks felt amazing as I massaged the dark crown of her hair, scratching at the little girl's scalp to milk a childish coo. We were of one mind, my little sweetheart and I, a primal heat filling her cheeks under my ministrations.*

Under the cover of 'Bring Your Child to Work Day', your lovely little loli accompanies you to the office for some down and dirty voyeurism. How many lewd hijinks can you get into before getting caught?!

Hell, you even looked forward to overtime when Rochelle was around. Even just the sight of Rochelle walking past you could send memories of the feel of her hot and soaked feet, the gentle, feminine smell of her sweat to your brain. The resulting erections made you consider jerking off in the office restrooms, but you avoided doing that, for now.*

>*"Come on in, not so timid, I don't bite! Take a seat, John... I can call you John, right?" he asks, that wide smile never leaving his face.*
>
>*Unsure in general, but sure of my station beneath him, I nod and give him a curt answer of "Of course, Mr. Adams.".*
>
>*The smile on his face is replaced by a look of mock disappointment. "Oh, John, you don't need to be so formal. Just call me Steve, we're all part of one big family here at GeneroCorp! Though we're not related by blood, so we can love each other all we want, too..." he says, sexual tension already building between us just from his tone of voice and phrasing. Then, with one swift movement of his hand under his desk, the lamps in the room begin to dim and the candlelight starts taking over the lighting. It's becoming more and more clear just what is going on here, and it seems like my boss is taking some sort of pleasure in making me squirm here, knowing full well that I can't disagree with anything without putting my job in jeopardy.*
>
>*With timidity audible in my voice, I just reply "Alright, M... um, Steve.", then look away. Right now, I'm out of my depth in every way—I had no idea he would be this blatant in hitting on me. But at the same time... he's cute. That smile of his seems so sincere, like he's not doing this just because he gets off on the power dynamic of bossing around his subordinates, but is actually into me in a personal way. And there's a part of me that is falling for it. Something about his immaculate feminine appearance is just so alluring that I can't help but start feeling turned on by it.*

It's been a few weeks since the owner's son has been installed as your new boss. While he has a few eccentric behaviors, none is more noticeable than his flamboyant behavior and his penchant for wearing women's clothing. If only he didn't look so god damn cute doing it, you might just be able to ignore it. Making matters worse, he's called you into his office after hours for a one-on-one performance review...

>*"Good morning," I greet them as I enter the office, sitting down at my tiny desk in one corner of the room. It's the only desk without a PC on it as well, which is entirely inappropriate, considering that they hired me as a programmer. 'Don't worry, we'll build you one tomorrow,' is what Jake set on my first day, but now it's been a week and I still don't have a way to actually work on any code. I brought my own laptop to work today though. Up to now, I used to just awkwardly sit in the corner, all dolled up as required by my personal dress code and twiddling my thumbs while the guys glance over now and then and stare at my tits for a while.*

You get hired as the only female employee to do programming at a small startup, but all you get is a bunch of brogrammers ordering you around, having you fetch coffee and making sexist comments. At least the pay is good.

>*"Stay calm, [Anon], you'll get through this day," you tell yourself as you inspected yourself in your office's bathroom mirror. A frown forced itself upon your lips as you kept staring, feeling your confidence falter at the sight of how much your eyes were trembling, giving away your anxiety. Today would be one of the most stressful days of your career. Your supervisor volunteered you to become a project lead a few weeks ago, and today you were asked to give your first report on the project's progress. It was the first time ever you would do such a thing.*
>
>*The week leading up to your report could not have gone worse, sadly. Some setbacks occurred, sure. But worst of all a new nickname for you spread around the office like wildfire.*

Be an (androgynous) gay, do crimes. But only if it's professional misconduct in the office.

>*"Eh? What happened?" she tries to get back up, but the rubble prevents her from doing so.*

>*As you look closer, it seems the shelf did not fall on her directly but wedged itself around her body. Jess herself is unharmed but immobilized by the tangle of furniture in this embarrassing position.*

>*"I'll get you out of there, just wait." you grab your phone and start taking pictures of that lovely butt sticking helplessly from the mess.*
>
>*"What are you doing?" you hear her voice.*

>*He picked it up, giving it a quick glance. It seemed to be a contract of employment, detailing the terms of a new position within her company. His eyes scanned over the page once more, noting that he was to work as an administrative assistant. A number of clauses detailed compensation and responsibilities, but there was nothing that stood out as particularly unusual. Nothing jumped out at him to indicate that something was wrong with it. In fact, it all seemed perfectly legitimate and just.*
>
>*"Due to the ambiguity of your soul, your employer has decided to employ your services for divine rehabilitation…" it stated plainly, ending with a line that read: "If any discrepancies arise between these terms and your actual performance in your role, your fate will be sealed."*
>
>*“And who is it who decides my fate?” he asked, turning a critical eye upon her face. "Or is this simply some sort of joke?”*
>
>*“All in due time,” she answered cryptically. “Just know that you have been hired for this task based on your past failures, impeccable work ethic, and high tolerance for pain.”*
>
>*He paused for a moment, weighing the situation. It was either remain left in the dark without a clue of who he was, or oblige and simply hope the woman would eventually reveal some truth. It should have been obvious which choice to make. He picked up the pen and signed the bottom line, using the only moniker he could think of at the moment: “Number 32.”*

You make sure to step to the side as you open the door, ensuring the goblin that gets the "red stain" treatment on the wall behind you doesn't sully your clothes. Upon entering you find the former succubus empress of the underworks chugging down a cup of 'vitality-enriched' espresso in seductive office wear that shows off her red body's curves in all the right places. Her blonde hair seems a bit more "burnt by hellfire" than usual, her cocytus-blue eyes are strained, and she's just finished crumpling the drink in her hand and tossing it into the pile of identical drinks behind her before addressing you in a sarcastic tone. "Oh hellooooo your evilness. I'm oh soooo honored you could make it 15 minutes late to the budget meeting on virgin blood tithes. Need I remind you we have a board room meeting with the Telesian mafia in an hour on protection racket rates? I don't know what I hate more, that I lost to you at Veningrad, or that you put me in charge of this mess of a world government while you are off playing tyrant with Dranoch the Glacial Lich."*

A month or so back, I asked him if he could give me a spare key to his place just in case something happens, and he did give me one. So far, I've had no reason to use it, but I think tonight will be the first time. The next thing I consider is getting out of this costume and changing into some normal clothes, but on second thought, I decide to keep this getup on. Maybe I can convince Taylor that we can have our own private Halloween party together, just the two of us.*

You turn your face this way and that; is that another wrinkle? If you were still in the mood to dress up for Halloween, you might consider going as the concept of inexorably marching time. That's a terror tried and true, but how would that costume even work? That's what you have on your mind when you dry your hands, flick the light off, and begin to slip through the bathroom door. You barely even register what the corner of your eye catches as you turn away; if not for the colossal shot of adrenaline your sympathetic nervous system just slammed into your veins, you might've missed it entirely.*

Red looked back over her shoulder at the moonlit street one final time before Anon closed the door behind her. An almost inaudible growl erupted from deep within her. Red had a bad feeling about this...*

>*You smile and continue to eat like a starving dog. About halfway through the meal however, you start to feel funny. A bit lightheaded and woozy, your body starts to waver to and fro.*
>
>*"These cookies taste kinda funny..." you say as your vision starts to blur and your feel your surroundings are a mile away.*
>
>*"That just means it's working. How lucky am I to find a cute boy like you here on Halloween?" you faintly hear before you fall limply back onto the couch and black out.*

You came to the wrong neighborhood.

A boy goes trick or treating alone and ends up at a strange house with a lady dressed in black leather and a witch hat. He thinks it's treat time and ends up getting drugged and tricked instead.

## The Friday of *Female Bullies*

Let's make prompts about those mean girls that just won't leave us alone god damnit

### *Tit for Tat*

{: .center}

>*The asinine pecking order of Broad River High meant that anthro girls like her got pushed around and bullied by the human kids. Wendy, the arbiter of her suffering, was the top dog at this dump, and her hatred for anthros—especially girls like Jamie—meant that this discrimination was enforced; and all Jamie could do was sit still and take it. The teachers wouldn't do anything—Wendy was too smart to be caught red-handed—and the other anthro kids hated the idea of forming a united front, saying it was "too much hassle" and "their futures were at stake". Well, what did they know? How could they experience routine humiliation for uncontrollable truths? As far as Jamie was concerned, so long as this carried on, she had no future. She had to do something about it.*

A timid mouse exacts her revenge against a smooth-skinned sadist.

>*"Look, [Anon]," Gina growled, "I can and will make your life a living shit-show if you spill any beans about knowing the past me. I...changed quite a bit. And I want to keep my current reputation."*

Reunite with and get bulled by your childhood friend, who really likes Gwen Stefani's discography.

### *Abusive Yandere GF*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2398>*
{: .center}

> *After a few days of her stalking you and you trying your best to talk to her so that she stops you decide that enough is enough.*
>
> *Today she is following you around from a distance like always.*
>
> *You let out an annoyed sigh and walk up to her.*
>
> *"FINE! IF YOU WANT TO STALK ME SO MUCH, HOW ABOUT WE JUST START DATING, HUH!? WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STOP!?" You shout with annoyance.*
>
> *"Really!?" She replies with a hopeful look.*
>
> *You have a feeling that you will regret this.*

Yeah, you're going to get fucked, in a bad way.

### *Ghoulish Girls*

{: .center}

>*Mind you, the news of my magical heritage seemed like an elaborate joke...until she callously transferred me from my very much 'human' school and shipped me off to this nightmarish parody of 'Monster High'. Had she lost her mind? Perhaps I was losing mine.*
>
>*"Well," Ms. Bilal shuffled some files to the side with relative disinterest, "you'll need to shadow someone on your first week."*
>
>*St. Nosferatu was relatively indiscernible from any other middle to upper-class high school, bar the ghoulish student body it hosted; from lycanthropes to manticores and everything slimy, scaly and even alluring in between.*
>
>*I tried to make the most of a poor situation and approach the opportunity with a scrap of optimism, "Sounds alright with me, I guess, a guy to follow around would be–"*
>
>*A chuckle from my newly appointed school counselor, "Sweetie, half of these boys would tear you apart, trust me." She paused as if scheming some cruel prank while I mulled over the torrid implications of the previous statement. "No, you'll need a girl to show you around," with that she sized me up like a slab of meat before faintly smirking, "I know just the clique."*
>
>*'Clique'?*

*Due to an 'unfortunate' loophole, you've been admitted to a high school that has traditionally only allowed monsters to enroll. To make matters worse, a trio of a spooky hotties have made it their mission to torment you, endlessly.*

>*Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed two things: that Harper had immediately pulled her phone out and begun idly flicking through it, and that as she had lay down, her skirt had slid down her leg to bunch around her hip, exposing a scandalous spread of her smooth caramel thigh. My pulse began to race, as much with excitement as with fear. I wanted to look away, to turn back to my work—but I couldn't. That fleeting glimpse of Harper's tanned flesh had taken a strange hold over me, one that gripped my heart with an icy hand even as it beckoned me closer with the other. Slowly, trying to make as little motion and noise as possible, I turned to look at her—bracing myself all the while, expecting her to look up from her phone and catch me staring at any moment.*
>
>*"So what do we do first, loser?" she suddenly spoke up.*

A student is assigned to work a school project with his bully.

### *Fire and Ice*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2403>*
{: .center}

>*Annah had never back down from a fight before and I heard whispers about us during the entire rest of the class about how we've been hanging out after school. Now not only did my mother think we were dating, but everyone at school as well. It was humiliating enough that people thought I was dating the person I hated the most, but the worst part was I couldn't stop thinking about her.*

A fiery violent girl becomes overly attached to an icy calm guy. Opposites attract, but also get in a lot of fights too.

>*Akari rushed towards the two older girls and interjected herself in-between the younger girl and the two older ones.*
>
>*"Bullying is wrong!" She precociously declared.*
>
>*The two older girls, the bullies, looked at each other, and then down on Akari and the little girl behind her. They smiled wickedly.*

"Transform: Anti-bully Ranger!"

>*The room in front of me was just your average storage room, fairly empty apart from one table. But it was what was on that table that disturbed me. Laying there, bound and gagged, was one of the two jocks that abused me the night before.*
>
>*"See... I told you I wouldn't leave you alone for too long. And look who I brought! Your friend from last night!" Gavin said, a wicked smile slowly forming on his face. "You remember him, right?" The first thing I noticed was the look of terror on the jock's face. The second thing... was his erection. I couldn't believe it—was he seriously getting turned on by this? It didn't take Gavin long to notice either, and he started laughing. "Oh, this is rich! The bully that loves making fun of us by calling us gay gets hard from being tied up by girly boys. What a twist... he's a masochist. Y'know... he looks kinda cute like this, all tied up and vulnerable."*
>
>*All the while, all I could do was stare. The sight in front of me was so confusing... and yet so alluring. I could feel my breathing quickening just looking at him, the one that hurt me, now tied up and defenseless. I wanted to have my way with him, to do to him what he did to me. Because he deserved to be punished. Gavin noticed my increasing tension and then decided to amp them up even further. He simply walked over to the jock, gently caressing his cheek with a smile. "Now, you'll be a good boy, right? Because if you aren't a good boy, I might have to call Victoria. And you don't want that, right?" he said softly.*
>
>*Vague disagreeing moans were all that managed to come through the jock's gag as he frantically shook his head. Gavin then walked over to my side, whispered "He's all yours... bully him good." into my ear and left the room. And so then there was silence. There was just me and the tied up and gagged jock in the room. Nobody else to see... nobody else to hear.*

Being a girly guy makes you a frequent target of bullying, especially if you're a new guy. But when another girly guy (and his huge enforcer girl) takes you under his wing, you find yourself on the other side. But for some reason, it's not just revenge that's on your mind...

>*Emly didn't want to cause any trouble, so she decided to just ignore Dolly. But Dolly wasn't about to let things slide.*
>
>*"I'll bet your family doesn't feed you properly, either." Dolly giggled. "They probably give you scraps like old bones and dead mice."*
>
>*Emly looked away from Dolly. "My mum feeds me well. We have lots of nice food to eat."*
>
>*Dolly snorted loudly out of her thick snout. "You look half starved to me. I'm surprised you can walk straight. You should be ashamed of yourself, being such a skinny thing."*
>
>*Emly stopped walking. "What do you mean? I'm not thin at all. My body is perfectly proportionate. What are you staring at anyway?"*
>
>*Dolly blinked rapidly, as if she hadn't heard what Emlyn had said. She took a few steps closer to Emlyn. "Your coat is really shabby looking, Emly. It's torn and frayed. And you smell funny—like something died in your coat. Did someone die in your coat?"*
>
>*Emly backed away nervously. "No, I've never seen anyone dead before. Why would you say that?"*
>
>*Dolly grinned wickedly. "Because you stink! Your fur stinks, it's disgusting!"*
>
>*The other animals nearby turned to stare at the two girls. Wattle the weasel whispered something to Titch the rat, who ran over to join Dolly. The weasel followed after her.*
>
>*Titch smiled at Emly. "It's true, isn't it? You stink. Let's see how bad it is."*
>
>*Wattle nodded her head vigorously in agreement with Titch. "Yes, she does stink. Let's get rid of those dirty clothes of hers!"*

Dolly and her cronies give Emly a makeover she didn't ask for.

{: .center}

>*Today, another feeding was scheduled for Flora, Megan regarded with jittery and excited feelings she couldn't quite place. Megan drove to the botany wing of the research facility, where Flora was kept, as she absent-mindedly thumbed through her phone across a list of interns, trying to decide on the best woman to feed to the hungry Alraune. She decided on a tall blonde intern named Katie, who looked like a pretty good choice to satisfy the hungry plant woman. Katie had long flowing blonde hair and an athletic build, and appeared to be quite attractive to Megan. Megan read that Katie had tested for a rather low IQ, so Megan reasoned it wouldn't be much of a loss if the big woman ended up as plant fertilizer.*

In this voracious story, a conflicted but professional female researcher named Megan Holmes is spearheading research on the development and life-cycles of many exotic creatures, specifically a predatory plant-girl placed under her care, named Flora. Embark on a journey of female debasement as Megan tends to Flora's needs like a skilled, but detached gardener, until the once dispassionate scientist reveals the increasingly lewd and debauched feedings are beginning to awaken something hidden deep inside her.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/rpfzol.jpg)
{: .center}

>*Alma is the head of HR for a successful international company known as HCC. She is a professional business woman, but her status as a large blue dragon has earned her a well-known reputation in the company. HCC hires many fresh, motivated female interns straight from college to work in their offices, but the performance of these trainee-employees is often lacking. Alma takes a hands-on approach to employee management, she helps motivate the workforce by swallowing the under-performing women who work at HCC, whole and alive, utilizing her impressive swallowing and digestion capacities as a twenty-foot long dragon.*

Alma is a professional in charge of keeping the company of HCC's workforce lean and mean. The female dragon is notorious for her unorthodox but effective motivational strategies- which often boil down to consuming under-performing employees from the company's diverse workforce whole and alive, something which has earned the blue-scaled dragoness a much feared reputation.

>*"You're insane," I said, gritting my teeth. "I'll tell the headmaster about this slander, and I'll see you expelled."*
>
>*Celine knelt before me. The hem of her skirt slipped up a fraction, and even through my anger I hated myself for noticing the pale strip of flesh it revealed: the creamy skin of her thigh. Her eyes were unreadable as they stared into mine. "Unfortunately for you," she said softly, "society changed while you were practicing at being a recluse. Your name does not hold the weight it once did. The House of Sarre has already fallen."*
>
>*Her words struck with a terrible force. She spoke them so bluntly, they rung with the weight of truth. As the knowledge seeped into my brain, I stared at her, eyes wide. When I spoke, my voice was hardly above a whisper. "What? How?"*
>
>*Celine reached out, her fingertips cool against my cheek. She leaned in, lips brushing my ear. Her breath was warm, and smelled of flowers. "My family made a similar deal. The fate of the Falaises is tied to the inverse of the Sarres. You see, [Anon], we are bound together. To secure my future, I need to destroy yours."*

Life has been hard for you ever since Celine Falaise arrived at the Academy. Ostracized by those you once called friends, you now spend your time alone. One night, Celine Falaise corners you into a fateful confrontation...

### *Sphinx Asks Bullshit Riddles Because She's Hungry*

>*The coach nodded to herself, and got the girls in the bus to step outside, which was difficult owing to the fantastical beast intently watching them from outside. Several of the volleyball athletes tried to film the mythological Sphinx, but they all found their phones lacked power and reception, mysteriously. Sophie waited until all the anxious, excited, and slightly scared women gathered with Lacy and Marge in front of Sophie, who appraised them happily as they assembled before her. The Sphinx then addressed the group: "Okay ladies, I'm sure you're all filled with questions right now, so I'll do my best to explain what's about to happen. I'm a Sphinx, and I enjoy asking people riddles. Guess my riddle correctly, and I'll help you leave, get it wrong though and well... We'll get to that part. Are you all following me so far?"*

Cats are notorious for enjoying to cruelly play with their food before eating it, and the ancient mythological sphinx is of no exception. Some of her riddles are a bit more well-thought out than others though, and the sly mythological lion-beast keeps a reserve of obtuse and unanswerable riddles in special reserve for a particularly sumptuous feast of tender female mortal flesh. A jaunty bus full of ill-advised female volley-ball stars have unknowingly landed themselves on the cross hairs of this ageless magical predator of the Egyptian deserts and Greek isles.

### *Hey Mom, Watch This*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2411>*
{: .center}

>*No one else in your life was ever vocally homophobic, but your mother... when you were growing up, she couldn't let a sighting or mention of a gay couple pass by without muttering something hateful under her breath. In middle school, when you wanted to get your hair cut in the popular style of the time, she said no, that it looked "faggy."*
>
>*And now Eric, who is only a couple years older, has seduced your mom. But he didn't seduce her because he wanted to have sex with her. Far from it. Eric is gay, in fact. Eric seduced her, convinced her he was into bondage, and tied her to her bed. And now, the door has opened and it's time for you to enter the room. It's time for your homophobic mother to spend the next three or more hours watching her son absolutely worship the big, hard, magnificent cock of someone he loves.*

Your conservative mother made you really uncomfortable with your sexuality growing up. Now it's time for her to become really comfortable with it, since she's tied up and about to watch you suck and fuck like the bisexual boyslut you are.

>*"Oi! Who the hell are you!" Sakura rose from her seat again and made a loud BANG! as she slammed her fists against the desk. This pervert freak just begged to have his ass kicked!*
>
>*The creepy foreigner placed some small device on top of the teacher's desk and then sat down next to it. He smiled at her. If Sakura was not so supremely confident in her ability to beat this scrawny old guy up, she'd perhaps feel scared.*
>
>*“I'm your Guidance Counselor, Sakura. Sit down, calm down and listen to me." His Japanese was terrible but his voice was deep and comforting. The small device next to the man seemed to hum along with every word as he spoke. The humming gave his words gravitas.*
>
>*The no longer furious Japanese girl immediately sat down and waited for the man to continue speaking. "How could she not know that he was her Guidance Counselor?!" Sakura admonished herself for being so stupid, to forget something like that. She still felt really weirded out about his chosen attire but she remained calm, waiting for the man to continue speaking. She needed to listen to her Guidance Counselor.*
>
>*“Man, considering everything I've heard about you, I expected you to be some kind of female ogre or something. But you're like, really cute!” Sakura's Guidance Counselor said in his deep voice. He seemed to consider something for a moment before he continued. “Hey, you do a lot of compensated dating with older men! You're basically a whore, isn't that right?”*
>
>*Sakura felt light-headed, it was as though her world was spinning for just moment. Perhaps, the humming from the device next to her Guidance Counselor grew more intense. Then, she nodded in agreement to his question. Although she had no memories of ever doing compensated dating or prostituting herself, there was not a shred of doubt in her mind that what her Guidance Counselor had just said about her was true. She did constantly go on compensated dates with old guys, and was basically a whore.*

A female bully receives some proper guidance from a concerned older gentleman with a mind control device.

### *Liyi and the Bastard*

>*Her hand slapped my fat belly, "Look at this, you're like a fucking pig." She said disgustedly, poking my stomach with her finger. "Like a big fat pig," she mocked. Again, I remained silent. She stepped forward, placing herself inches from my nose. "What's your name?" She asked, looking down into my eyes.*
>
>*"No, no, I don't want to know...I'll just called you pig." She cruelly chortled with a couple light slaps on my face. I didn't flinch. She grabbed my head, pulling my face to hers, "Pig." She repeated. I was silent.*
>
>*Liyi was discovering that she could do whatever she wanted to me, insult me, use me, berate me, and I wouldn't respond. She seemed to like that. My silence and lack of reaction to her taunts and abuse had become her entertainment.*

A gym shark decides to spend her night picking on the local fat bastard, (You). She can be dominate or you can awaken your inner mind breaking talent.

### *A Break Up By Phone*

>*"I just don't know what to do, Phil. Do you have any ideas?" he finally asks, looking at me with an expression that looks utterly lost.*
>
>*Of course, I know immediately what my answer is. "You've got to dump her, man. It's not healthy to stick around with her. She'll probably ruin you if you keep trying to keep up with her." I reply before refilling his glass with some more liquor.*
>
>*"But how? I can't just tell her we're finished... I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that." he says, worry evident in his voice. That much is right—James is too much of a pushover. He was raised to always be his best, but never got to the point where he realized people can abuse that kindness.*
>
>*"Well, I've got to admit, I'm not sure myself. But you know what? Just stay over tonight. We can talk about good old times, have some more drinks, and I bet we'll come up with something." I suggest with a smile.*
>
>*James takes a few moments to think about it, but eventually he simply nods his head. I'm very glad he accepted, because I'm certain that a night together with his best friend is exactly what he needs. And so, our night of memories and alcohol begins. We take trips down memory lane and take some more shots of liquor, and it seems that it's working, as James definitely seems to be feeling better. But all the while, I'm still thinking about how he could break up with his abusive girlfriend. And while it might be because I'm getting drunk, I suddenly have an idea that I think could work.*
>
>*"Hey, James... you wanna really piss off your soon to be ex-girlfriend?" I ask him.*
>
>*I thought that he might have some trepidation about this whole thing, but it seems that the alcohol is getting to him as well, so he replies "Yeah, man, let me hear it.".*

One day, your best friend sends you an ominous text message that he needs to come over and that it's important. An hour and a drink or two later, it becomes clear that his girlfriend has been abusive to him, and he feels like he has to break up with her, but doesn't know how. And it might just be the alcohol, but you think you have a great idea that ends up with him being together with someone that really cares about him...

>*Everything was silent in my apartment for a moment. Then, I turned, calling out sternly, "Evie!" There was a flutter of wings, and a scrambling from deeper into my apartment as Evie ran to answer me. After a moment, she ran in from the kitchen, the feathers of her wings all a-fluff, a distinct smugness to her demeanor.*
>
>*"Hello master! Did the mean human girl go away now?" she chirped cheerily, her arms folded behind her back as she looked up at me.*
>
>*I crossed my arms over my chest, glaring down at her sternly. "Sierra was my girlfriend, Evie, and she deserved to be treated with respect, not terrorized like that. Why do you always do this to my girlfriends?" I scolded.*
>
>*"Hm? What are you talking about, master?" she asked, putting on an air of innocent confusion.*
>
>*"You tear up their clothes, break their things, and harass them every time they come to visit! Five of my girlfriends have broken up with me because of you, Evie! Five!" I pointed accusingly at her.*
>
>*Evie scowled, her wings fluffing up a bit. "Stupid human girls shouldn't be with master! Master should be with Evie, not stupid humans!" she yelled, stomping her little foot angrily and pouting.*

Your bratty birdgirl keeps chasing away all your girlfriends, eager to have you all for herself — and to make you like it.

>*When you arrive at the sleepover, you come dressed in a sweater and a cute black skirt. Emily lets you in and you're the first one there. She sits on the couch with you until Mary and Amelia arrive. The sleepover goes on normally and you talk, play games, eat, and have a little bit to drink. Afterwards, the three of you decide to play Truth or Dare. The game goes on for a bit and you can tell the girls are all very interested in you. You wonder to yourself why girls are always staring at you. Just then Emily asks you, "Truth or dare?"*
>
>*You look at her and respond: "Dare." Emily suddenly gets a sadistic smile on her face. The other two girls look at her anxiously. You blush and realize what's going on.*
>
>*"I dare you to take off all of your clothes in front of us." You feel your heart start to race and your face burns. The girls start to giggle at your embarrassment. When you try to ask for a different dare she responds, "Alright, then I dare you to do whatever we say for the rest of the night!"*
>
>*"That's even worse!" you yell.*

You're the only boy at the sleepover, but they can't tell...

Your friend, Emily, invites you to her sleep over, along with 2 of her other friends. You will be the only boy at the sleepover, even though Emily thinks you're a girl.

### *An Unexpected Coed Visit*
{: .center}

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2423>*
{: .center}

>*"Jane? What are you doing here? How, how do you even know where I live?" you stammered, recognizing the odd 'gyaru' woman you share a few courses with. You hadn't dealt much with her personally. Outside of being the butt of several jokes she liked to make about you with others. You never found out why she ended up harassing you like that and with time things had sort of settled down to the occasional gag about your virginity and similar things. Trying to process this woman's sudden intrusion didn't help with your rising confusion.*
>
>*"Easy. I, like, simply asked one of those other geek friends of yours. I don't know why but one of them started crying when I talked to them. LOL." She actually said 'LOL' out loud. What the fuck.*
>
>*You gently shook your head in an attempt to clear your mind. A friend, or soon to be ex-friend, had told Jane where you live. "What do you want here?" you pressed, the soreness of your throat making you sound more confident than you really were.*
>
>*Jane simply grinned wickedly and winked, muttering something you couldn't quite hear. When you moved to ask her to leave Jane lunged forward, grabbing your wrists and pinning you against a wall. Her face was flushed with excitement as she saw and felt you struggle in vain. "Holy shit, you're like, super weak right now, right? Lol, I could totally rape you I think."*

Your uni co-ed Jane does a rape. Probably won't get any jail time.

>*"Excuse me," says a voice.*
>
>*You raise your head and see a businesswoman sitting beside you, dressed in a stylish gray suit and carrying a briefcase. Her black hair is neat, piled in a bun; her brown eyes are clear and alert. She is beautiful, out of place in this grimy subway station, with her fresh face and soft features. Your eyes drop down to her figure, slender yet voluptuous under her prim suit. She smiles, dimples creasing her cheeks, seeming to notice your gaze. Her brown eyes flicker with amusement.*
>
>*"Would you like to play a game?" she asks. Her voice is crisp and professional, her hands folded primly in her lap. "It's a simple one. We each have a card, and take turns tossing our card down to try to flip over the opponent's. If you succeed in flipping over the opponent's card, you win the round. If not, you lose."*
>
>*The hell? Is this some kind of cult recruitment? You snap, "Do I look like I'm in the mood for a game?"*
>
>*"The loser of each round," the woman continues implacably, "pays their opponent one thousand dollars. In other words, if you win a round, I pay you. We can play for more than one round, of course."*
>
>*Your eyes widen as her words sink in. One thousand dollars. That's enough to pay off the next minimum payment from the loan shark. And if you win more rounds...This is insane. But how the hell else are you going to get the cash? Fuck it. What's the worst that'll happen? Before you know it, you're on your feet. "I'm in."*

You are crushed by debt. If you don't pay up in a week, the loan sharks intend on taking your kidneys. When all hope seems lost, a well-dressed businesswoman offers you a certain opportunity.

>*Jake's younger sister, Samantha, had always been artistic. His younger sister by two years, she possessed distinguished drawing skills from a young age. Though studying chemistry in the same college as Jake, she continued to hone her craft on the side with the art department. In retrospect, Jake did not know why he never considered that she might show up that night.*
>
>*As Jake walked into the studio where he would be posing, he almost immediately locked eyes with Samantha, and shared with her a look of horror.*
>
>*"Good evening class," the professor began with complete unawareness of this development. "I'd like to introduce tonight's model, Jake. It is very kind of him to agree to posing for you tonight, and we greatly appreciate it. Without further ado, let's begin."*

Jake, a college student, is hoping to earn a few easy bucks modeling for his school's art department. Things get uncomfortable when his sister shows up.

>*My little sister, Julia, was always a little wild. Where I would obey the rules, she'd break them. She learned early that taking her clothes off was the most fun transgression.*
>
>*This didn't change as she got older. It was a summer night at around 2 AM when I went into the kitchen looking for food. Thinking I heard something in from the backyard pool, I quietly opened the door and stepped out.*
>
>*Sure enough, there was a figure in the pool. Trying to see who it was I stepped out a bit further quietly. As my eyes adjusted, it was obvious it was my sister. I relaxed, only to realize she was nude.*
>
>*I couldn't help but gasp, and her head shot up as she realized I was there. With a quiet yelp of her own, she flung herself to the edge to cover herself.*
>
>*"What are you doing?" she asked, as if I were the one who made this happen.*

>*"You... what is this?" Claire managed to get out through gritted teeth. Even though her body could not move, she could still speak it seemed.*
>
>*"It's so cool, Claire!" Anon's beady little eyes shone as he talked. "This stone will finally let me transform you into my new, ideal little sister, my dream imouto! Oh, and don't worry, sis! After the process is done, you'll be able to move again. I think..."*
>
>*Claire concluded that there was only one answer to what was going on. Her brother had lost it completely! He had watched too much anime, or played too many video games, and his mind had finally rotted away. Claire understood that the word “imouto” that Anon had used meant little sister in Japanese. But what the hell had he done to her? Did he drug her or something?!*
>
>*Suddenly, interrupting any chance for further contemplation, Claire felt as though a hot metal blade had been driven into her head, straight to her skull. The pain quickly subsided as new thoughts and emotions flooded her. "Anon is a wonderful older brother! Claire loves her older brother more than anything! Claire must please Anon. Claire must willingly serve her wonderful older brother's every need! Claire is a loving imouto!"*

Claire is a smoking hot, high school student swimming sensation living her dream life. Well, if not for the fact that must share her home with the ugly, useless, pervert bastard that is her older brother Anon. Unfortunately for Claire, Anon recently ordered a magical object called an "imouto stone" from an online store. Will this magic gemstone change their relationship to better appeal to Anon's twisted desires?

>
>*"What should we do with these ones?" an elf mused. "The last group we gave to the tentacle monster, do we want to do that again?"*
>
>*Amanda whimpered softly as she knelt naked before her captors. Her legs shook uncontrollably. She was terrified beyond reason.*
>
>*I wanted to stand tall and bravely face my fate, but found it impossible. My body trembled like jelly, unable to support itself. It felt as though my insides were being squeezed by some invisible hand.*
>
>*"We could do the usual and have them mate here," another elf suggested. "That way they can get acquainted with the pleasure of serving us."*
>
>*My stomach lurched violently as a wave of nausea swept over me. I choked back vomit and fought to hold down what I was feeling.*
>
>*"Better to start with it than stand around debating," another conceded. "I'll begin the magic"*

A prince and his sister are captured by high elves. Sexual humiliation ensues.

>*I used to enjoy being an older sister, looking after my little sis while waiting for the days when I could help her learn all about makeup and boys and cute outfits. But when the time came, my little sister Emily had something very unusual happen. Between her legs, she sprouted something extra. At first it was just an odd knub of skin sticking out from her groin, no bigger than a knuckle, which she showed me one day with embarassment and confusion on her young face. It didn't stop there, growing until Mom got involved and got her to the doctor where they explained that Emily was a very rare kind of hermaphrodite. Her body was developing completly functional sets of male and female bits down there.*
>
>*Mom and I didn't really know what to make of it, but we were there for Emily, knowing that puberty was a strange and hard enough time for an ordinary girl, let alone one with a twig and berries growing in her pants.*

My little sister is growing up into a huge futa.

>*You are helplessly dropped onto the bed as she gently begins to remove your shirt and shorts. The scent of the room and her touch on your body is sending you down a hormonal frenzy but you resist with great effort and continue.*
>
>*"No, I mean they didn't have a willy, and their chest, well, it looked kinda like yours and smaller. I think they were called a woman."*
>
>*Your blood ran cold as you felt her stop in her tracks.*
>
>*"Uhuh... and why are you bringing this up now baby?"*
>
>*While the tone was still pleasant, the cadence was a bit menacing, and you shrunk back a bit as she started pouring lubricant on her semen extraction ports.*
>
>*"I was thinking... that maybe... I could... meet one and...have sex?"*
>
>*The room was dead silent as you heard her processors spin in contemplation. You have the feeling she is about to make this session a bit more "educational" than you'd like. She had made it clear that she would not tolerate any discussion of your interest in meeting other humans, and these "women" seemed to especially upset her so you brace yourself for whatever punishment is coming your way.*

>*The prince tried to follow along, but he was caught up on one implication that he wished to have clarified. "Mother, when you say 'within ourselves', do you mean..."*
>
>*She looked away slightly in shame. "Yes, it is as you suspect. Your father was my uncle's son, and my mother's nephew. Put simply, we were cousins. Were I to reveal more of our family tree, it would admittedly look more like a shrub."*
>*The young prince reeled from this. "Wait, is that why both my grandfathers looked so much alike?"*
>
>*"Let's not get into too much detail. The important part is that you are our only child, and your uncles and aunts all bore sons. Beyond even that, your youngest aunt is too old to bear children, thus..."*
>
>*She looked down as she slowly reached for his crotch before continuing. "I suppose that means that as the youngest female family member, the responsibility of siring your offspring..." The queen looked up and said: "Belongs to me."*

>*Mrs. Ortega gives him a fond smile, "Niño, none of this 'ma'am' nonsense. Call me Camila." She reaches over, affectionately ruffling Lucas's hair, and the boy can't help but smile at the gesture.*
>
>*"Okay, Mrs- I mean, Camila," Lucas replies, heart fluttering a bit at the way Camila smiles brightly at him in response, evidently pleased.*
>
>*"Come in, está frío afuera, te vas a enfermar," she tuts, taking the boy's hand in her own and leading him into the house, closing the door behind them. Her house is cozy and comfortable, decorated in warm earthy colors, with lots of comfy furniture and homely knick-knacks everywhere. As they walk through Camila's house, Lucas looks around, noticing the photos on the wall. Most of them are family photos of Camila and what must be her children over the years, the photos ranging from her children in their infancy to them as grown adult men and women with young children of their own. It's clear his neighbor holds these photos in high esteem — they don't have a speck of dust on them, and they're all placed in well-trafficked areas of the house.*
>
>*Lucas turns his gaze back to Camila as they approach the kitchen. Camila's hips swing as she walks, and he blushes at the sight of her ample ass jiggling gently beneath the hem of her jeans. He's been starting to develop an interest in girls, and he finds himself looking at Camila's voluptuous body in a new light than he has in previous years. The thought makes him blush even more, but he tries not to let it show.*

>*The realization dawned on him, his apprehension melting away in an instant into utter bliss as he ran out to her with open arms, "Mommy!" he cried, grabbing her hand as she reached towards him. She smiled back, taking note of the look of pure adoration in his eyes before enveloping him in a hug, squeezing gently. His warm body radiated joy, and she basked in the sensation, feeling his unbridled relief and comfort wash over into her. She was, if nothing else, a creature of fulfillment that responded to aching need. And this boy was very needy.*
>
>*"Tell me, Mommy," he said with his face half buried in the silk of her dress, "tell me you won't ever leave. You're here to stay forever and ever, aren't you?"*
>
>*There was the small matter of needing a particular kind of sustenance that a child was ill-equipped to provide, but that bridge could be crossed later. For now, she reassured him, stroking his thin mop of hair, "Of course, sweetie, Mommy isn't going anywhere."*

A succubus serves a new master… a little boy that desperately wants a friend, and a mommy.

>*Though he indeed was familiar with White Snake's true identity, Ivarella Kagura, through her public persona, her visage had somewhat stunned the young man.*
>
>*Her silken locks of pure-white hair cascaded down her back and over her shoulders, flowing freely as she spoke the usual villain monologue, her serene, mellowed voice carrying an air of authority and confidence. Her narrow eyes, slanted downward, almost pierced through the mask of his and right into his souls with their alluring gaze. Her full lips, crinkled with a touch of age, flapped about with precise movements as words left her mouth, entered one ear and exited the other.*
>
>*Her white kimono was evidently tailor-made for her body by an artisan, its floral patterns and designs were exquisite and beautiful, contrasting with her reptilian lower half. It sat snuggly against her voluptuous, curvaceous figure, draping over the sagging flesh of her breasts and hips, accentuating the ample curves of her bust. The white feathers of her serpentine lower half, which resembled a snake, granted the powerful businesswoman a majestic, regal aura that the Crimson Hopper's true identity was mesmerized by.*
>
>*"…And yet, here you are, brazenly threatening to ruin everything I have worked for. Me, who has long devoted my life to this city, its people, and the children that live in it. And now, you have come to destroy the very thing that gives meaning to all that I have done. Don't you—wait, are you even listening to me?"*
>
>*Crimson Hopper merely stood there, his gaze fixed on the older woman, unmoving. The older woman had finally noticed the subtle leers and glares coming from the masked vigilante, and she could tell he wasn't paying attention to a word that came out of her mouth, but rather, her looks.*
>
>*"You… are staring quite intensely at me, aren't you?"*

The courageous hero of justice, the Crimson Hopper, had managed to find out the true identity of the mastermind behind one of Duval's most nefarious criminal organizations. Will he be able to defeat the elusive White Snake, who turned out to be a middle-aged beauty?

>
>*"What are you doing, mom? Wait why am I naked?"*
>
>*"I dragged your boxers off while you were sleeping. They would get in the way." she gives your shaft a gentle motherly kiss.*
>
>*"Are you gonna do this again? You don't have to, you know..."*
>
>*"But isn't it hard to pee with a boner like that?" her big green eyes look at you with an upward glance.*

>
>*I opened the door wide to let the stranger enter. She walked past me without so much as glancing down. As she passed, her wide and rolling hip made solid contact with my midriff. I was knocked off balance and staggered into the wall. This woman had some serious heft to her movements. If she noticed the impact, she gave no indication. It intimidated me somewhat, and I swallowed down my complaint without speaking. I followed behind her*
>
>*She turned around slowly, taking in every inch of my house. The way she moved was predatory and seductive all at once. I found myself staring. She reached out to touch a vase sitting atop my desk. Her fingers lingered briefly on its surface. Then she picked it up and examined it closely. I watched as she ran her hands along the length of the vase, admiring the craftsmanship. Her movements were slow and deliberate, almost languid. She set it down, then spoke again.*
>
>*"Do you know who I am, Barry?" The tall woman asked, slinking back to loom over me.*
>
>*"No..." I stammered out a reply. There was something so familiar about her, something I just couldn't put my finger on... Oh shit.*
>
>*"Oh right, I'm wearing my disguise. " She demurred, tapping her chin. "It's Mommy, sweetie. I'm back."*

>*Yes, I know I'm a guy, and he's a guy, and he's just one year younger than me—it doesn't change the fact that I feel like a mom. And it's not like he's fighting this dynamic either, in fact, he's just encouraging it. Brett just loves it when I dote on him, whether it's cooking his favorite food, cuddling him when he feels down, or just being there for him no matter what he needs. He makes those cute noises sometimes when I'm hugging him, and his smile when he's happy is just absolutely angelic. He is the love of my life, and I'll be his mommy and his big brother for the rest of his life if it just means I get to protect that smile, you know?*

I've been living with Brett for so long now that I can't even remember my life without him. Ever since an accident took his parents from him at a young age and he was adopted into my family, we've been like brothers. And while my parents did take care of him through our youth, as we've gotten older, I've taken a lot more of an interest in supporting him directly. Now we live on our own as we go to college, and I feel almost like a doting mother at this point. So when Brett comes home crushed because his girlfriend of four months that he loved dropped him like a hot potato, I have to comfort him, then remind him that he can rely on me for everything... absolutely everything.

>*Reaching a large open clearing in the middle of the woods, I stop walking and stare at it intently, admiring its beauty from every angle. It's perfect... just how nature intended, a perfect canvas for the sickening act I intend to perform here. Sweat drips down my forehead as I drop to my knees, gripping the spade with both of my trembling hands. I'm so aroused I can barely concentrate, but then again who could blame me? Slowly, almost sensually, I dig into the earth, forming a small damp vagina-like crevice into the ground before me.*

With my favorite stuffed animal in tow, I opened my bedroom door and, after a moment to psych myself upon seeing how dark the house was in the middle of the night — despite the nightlights dotted around — made my way down the hallway towards my parents' room. Or, more accurately, Mom's room, since Dad had left many years ago and never come back. I reached up to the doorknob, turning it quietly and, after a moment, walking inside. I made my way over to Mom's bed and, reaching up, tugged on the sheets a bit to try to wake Mom up. "Mom?"*

>
>*Before I could say anything, she noticed me, and beckoned me over. "You know you're supposed to be asleep, right, sweetie?" Her voice, warm and comforting, washed over me. I felt like I could tell her almost anything. I shrugged and said, "I dunno, I just...couldn't sleep."*
>
>*Far from being mad at me, Mom chuckled and said she also had difficulty sleeping. After a moment, she asked, "Want to watch a bit of TV with Mommy before I tuck you back in?" I nervously nodded. My mom, as sweet as she is, rarely allowed me to stay up late. She pulled her blanket up a bit and patted the couch next to her. "Come on, sweetie, come snuggle with Mommy."*

I've never been this big before. To have made it this far through all the rough fucking your mommy has done with so many hard cocks riding her bareback, you must be fighters. And I can feel it, you want to be born, to live and see the world outside Mommy so badly. I can barely stand holding off the urge to push you out of there. You were supposed to come out months ago, so those pills I took to drag this out as long as possible worked. But I have to let you know that you're not going to make it.*

>*It has been five years since I have married Naiya. It's been four since we had our first child, Neeri. I love my new family with all of my heart, but I know the life of a mage is a lonely one. I can stand being isolated in a castle of my own making, with pine-covered mountain ranges on one side and the open ocean on the other separating us all from civilization "for its own protection from my magic". When I was young and it was just me, a soldier who went down the magical rabbit hole, I accepted my lord's reasoning back then and was fine with being alone. But my new family grew tired of the loneliness and surprisingly so did I. So here we am now, sailing along the coast on a galley built from the pine that surrounded my castle and crewed by automatons I created myself.*

>*But it wasn't until my graduation that I truly came to understand just how deep my love for my mother had become. I had several beautiful girls all ask me out over the course of the year, but I had rejected all of them. All except one, who had asked me a month before the end of the semester. We dated for two weeks before I came to realize that no matter how much I forced it, how I longed to ignore it, this beautiful and talented girl just did not compare in my eyes to my mother. Try as I might to love her, I was unable to feel even a fraction of the spark I felt when I thought of my sweet mom. Knowing she deserved better, I ended our relationship. Where I expected a pang of guilt, I instead felt the relief of freedom. My heart was once again free to love the only woman in my life that mattered to me. And when I finally graduated, and I saw mother in the crowd cheering me on, I had made my decision. I would make her my wife, just as I had promised her all those years ago as a child.*

>
>*The Chieftain’s story sounded true, at least from the hazy memories I could piece together. Before I could open my mouth to respond, Kleo gingerly placed her finger against my lips and shushed me. "You may ask more questions later. For now, you must drink and gain your strength back."*

Trapped in an Amazon jungle, I'm being (literally) nursed back to health by a BBW Amazon mommy. I wonder what else could happen with this tribe?

They sound much bigger than you, surely not someone you would want to mess with—perhaps a guard of the simulation, coming to take you to whatever comes next? The door swings open, and you stare in confused astonishment as none other than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks back at you—though it is not so much the fact that it is AOC that astonishes you. What astonishes you is that unlike the diminutive AOC of the real world, this AOC stands at what must be at least seven feet tall, and with a voluptuous Rubenesque body that puts even the most depraved, horny internet memes of the politician to shame.*
>
>*"Hello there, Anon! I was wondering when you'd wake up," says the giant AOC, giving you a warm smile.*

In the near future, The Squad reigns supreme in America. You are hooked up to a VR simulation in which a MILF version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez convinces you of the benefits of socialism with mommy characteristics.

>
>*You raise an eyebrow, “Oh really?”.*
>
>*“Yes, yes! If you press the green button whilst pointing this at someone they will do anything you tell them to do, anything!” he has a crazed smile on his face. “The best part is they won’t remember a thing!”*
>
>*“That sounds rather sketchy…” you say uncomfortably, and take a step backwards.*
>
>*“It’s fine, it’s fine! I call the object, the ‘Controller’!” he puffs his chest out proudly.*
>
>*“Very creative” you mutter, what a load of nonsense.

>*Now standing before her, I started to wonder if I would meet the same fate as my predecessors. Not likely, I mused grimly as I looked at her collection of slaves. She seems to prefer women.*
>
>*With my first step into the chamber, I could feel the strength of her psychic powers. Already she was probing at my mind, searching for weaknesses. I focused, resolute to show her none.*
>
>*With a practiced breath, I let out my control lines and began to probe her mind in turn. It was only for a split second, but I knew I saw that unmistakable look on her face: the look of surprise. The Mindflayer was not the only psychic in the room.*

A rare breed of monster hunter, you are the Mind-Bender, a master of psychic battles. You are facing what could be your toughest opponent yet, a powerful Mindflayer.

Long, honey wheat-colored hair retaining much of its length, a single braid rested over her exposed shoulder and easily fell to her waist. Body wise....was it ok to see her like this? You couldn't fully tell but many of Gilda's thick Dwarven assets were very much depleted; there was still an alluring shape to her frame though you dared not admit it.*

Mitigating factors. Our hands are tied. Deep Rock Galactic will record your sacrifice. Sorry boys." The link went dead.*

>*The Dwarves looked at one another with apprehension. They were thousands of meters underground, surrounded by endless multitudes of insectoid abominations, low on ammo, with only each other to depend on for survival. "Well, there's no use crying over spilt beer, is there?" the Gunner snorted, chomping on his cigar.*

She was set into the wall of the cavern, her silvery surface clad only in bare stone, the rock wall hugging her form tightly in it's unyielding embrace. The mere sight of her was enough to weaken Urist's knees, to set his heart pounding furiously in his chest.*

>*Trading his empty flagon for the pickaxe he'd left there earlier, the dwarf approached her almost timidly, struck by her beauty.*

>*"It's me, Urist," he slurred, stars dancing in his eyes. "I've come for you."*

A dwarf, Urist, is possessed by a strange mood, and makes his way deep into the mines for a moonlight rendezvous.

Was I just being set up for a fall here, or could it be that none of us had ever seen the true face of James and I'm seeing something he only shows to a very select few? At the very least, I should do what he says, given that he could have me expelled with a wave of his hand, so I grab a nearby stool and sit close to him as I watch in awe.*

A mysterious call for piano students on the school pin board has gotten me closer to the school's hated rich kid than I ever thought I would, and it turns out he's just a scared boy that wants someone to like him for who he is[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea2WoUtbzuw)

But any sort of negative feelings I could have had just fly away as I feel her hand brush against my cheek before carefully cupping it. My eyes meet hers again, and I wonder how I could have, even for a moment, thought that this meant that she would think less of me. I'm sure she knows of my trepidation, my worries... but now that it's been all laid out with just a few gestures and words, there's no reason to ever hold back anymore. Her thumb caresses my cheek like a mother would do to a troubled child to calm it down again, those motherly notions that Akari had for me coming to the forefront again. She really just wants me to be my best, and that includes being open with my feelings. I realize that now.*

But before I can reply, something strange happens. Emotions start bubbling up inside of me, and before I know it, tears are starting to form in my eyes. It's like all the pent up fear over being exposed has come back all at once now that I feel free.*

When I, the star quarterback of the school, was caught in my hobby of wearing women's panties in secret by a diminutive nerd, I thought my athletic career was either over or worse, I was going to be blackmailed.

I could see the faintest hint of the sun peeking over the horizon, casting a glow across the snow-dusted fields. A soft gold tinted the underside of clouds, and the horizon was painted a gentle pink that faded into blue as I traced my eyes upward.*

She wore a light beach cardigan over her bikini top, which strained to cover her ample breasts. My eyes traced their way down to her taut midriff, ending at a neon bikini bottom, revealing a pair of long, shapely legs. Her wavy blonde hair tumbled past her shoulders, catching the rays of sunshine. There was something about her smile that made my stomach flutter; she had an almost mischievous look in her eye as she gazed up at me. She grinned as she leaned forward and said, "Hey, you look lost."*

However, you'd recently noticed some glances between your students. It's normally fairly difficult to keep schemes a secret from a teacher, but if they had anything planned aside from the standard pranks, you weren't aware. Sure, one of the more devious girls had tried putting tacks on your seat — you'd nearly fallen for that once — and tried rearranging your papers, but this felt bigger than that.*

You're a teacher for a class full of mischievous girls. What could go wrong?

Just you wait, Matthew, if I'm right about this, I'm having the last laugh here. As we continue walking through the dunes, searching for treasure, I feel myself starting to sweat more heavily. This must be the potion taking effect, as Matthew seems to be feeling it as well. And then it happens. With a "Hey, give me some of the water you're carrying, I think I'm parched...", Matthew turns around, our eyes meet, and the potion works its magic. I can feel my picture of him being rewritten as I think about it, becoming more beautiful, more lovable.*

As a battle goes on in a vast desert, a young tactician and a young thief remain behind, searching the dunes for treasure. When they stumble across an odd potion, they figure they could either let a mage identify it... or they could just experiment, try it, and see what happens. And so, thanks to some goading from the thief and some bets, both of them try the potion... only to find it was a love potion. And so, both forget they're close to a battle, the thief forgot his grief about his slain lover, and the tactician forgot all the restraint they told themselves they'd show, and desire takes hold.

>*"You aren't human, you're a monster; lower than dirt." strong-willed and incredibly arrogant, Threo was a bit out of her element; an earlier battle with your strongest goons had knocked her down a peg, if only temporarily.*
>
>*"Hmph, it took five of my best men to subdue you even for a moment, but a moment was all I needed; I'll be sure that they get to sample you."*
>
>*"'Sample'?" Not for an instant did Threo's confidence falter, but even she could understand her compromised position. The pillory that secured her neck and wrist had been expertly made and specifically for her; she was utterly helpless.*

Something of a capitalist, you understand the market demand for two things: fresh Draph milk and their powdered horns. Luckily for you, you hold a monopoly on both.

>*"No! This is too embarrassing!"*
>
>*"Well, if you can't, then there is nothing we can do. Just skip this season and try next year. Guess you are too young for work after all..." - you are trying to provoke her.*
>
>*"Are you mocking me? I can do it just as good as any other fairy, if not better!" - she throws a little tantrum, lowering her defenses. At this moment you catch her naked body in the palm of your hand with one swift motion, restraining the petite fae.*

After a horrible catastrophe wiped out all bees and many other insects humans had to employ fairies to prevent most types of plants from going extinct.

>*Deltamonte motions towards the scene, "Yes, the factory workers will grade each womb for viability, grading A through F, and then each womb will be paired with a monster for breeding."*

{: .center}

>*"Well…" It wasn't the most decisive strategy, but it was my best bet. Dog girls were known for their keen sense of smell—something I openly envied her for—and they could detect subtleties in a fragrance that were completely lost on humans. Although she lacked my years of expertise, it was conceivable that she could not just pick up on things far beyond my abilities, but also identify potential aromatic sources that could be used to produce the right formula. "You'll need to lend me your nose. We'll examine some live specimens."*
>
>*"Live specimens?!" she gasped. "Like real penises?! Are we really going through with this plan?"*
>
>*"Come on, I'm sure you've stuck your nose in more embarrassing places," I reminded her lightly. She blushed furiously. "Oh, and although I said 'live specimens', I obviously don't have the luxury of keeping my cellar stocked with young, virile human males, so you'll have to make do with me."*

>*Saffron had turned bright red by now, but she nodded anyway.*

>
>*He nodded silently, not wanting to speak out of turn and risk punishment.*
>
>*"Good," she said, smiling down at him and stroking his hair. "Let's feed you first then. You'll produce more with a full belly."*

What had started as a minor disagreement over milk quotas, spiralled into something much more sinister. Fed up with their human oppressors, the once docile Holstaurs had risen up, capturing their owners and forcing them to submit to the same exploitation they doled out—being milked dry every day.

>*"Women?" You moved a bit closer, mere inches from Sadie's cute, flustered face, "lady, these are livestock. We've been breeding these bimbos for decades." The reality was that 50 years ago humans had re-organized society in such a way that it sought to reestablish balance with nature, opting on utilizing the undesirable leeches of the cities for more 'suitable' and sustainable roles as 'farm hands'. Over time, these 'farm hands' were more aptly recognized as livestock. A proud 'human heifer' farmer, you took this philosophy to the extreme, "you're a strange one, really; you hippies and your wiles."*

>*There, on that beach, I swore upon my heart an oath, which I carry with me to this day: I will drag them down, not just to our level, to the darkness of mankind, but even further, to a realm beneath us. I would show them their own corruption, for all the world to see, and force them to know the depths of regret, until there was no choice left except for them to accept their rightful place as our inferiors. No other outcome could be tolerated.*

>
>*One by one, the same terror dawned on the faces of Lan's family as they realized what this meant. There was only one reason for the Japanese forces to stop the bombardment; so their own troops could move in and occupy the city. Even as the thought sank in, Lan heard voices approaching, shouting in Japanese—soldiers, moving through the streets of Nanjing in groups. Lan's nightmare had only just begun.*

The savage hesitated, but then crawled towards me on all fours.*

>
>*"My spring has not yet healed your wounds."*
>
>*From out of the lush foliage emerged a humanoid form! Her silvery hair was adorned with a variety of flowers. Her ample breasts and womanly hips were barely covered by a tangle of vines, her only clothing.*

>*"Her name is Mythia," Cyric starts. "They forced her to fight against large insects and small forest creatures like a gladiator. Also, instead of feeding Mythia fruit and nectar, they made her hunt and kill feeder crickets. She seems to have mental trauma. Worst of all, the sick fucks live-streamed all of it on twitch."*

>*You shake your head, "Luna and I will do our best, Detective," you tell him as he and his partner walk out the door.*

>
>*"Geez, you must be exhausted." - you look at her, her hair and summer dress are dirty, and her body have bruise marks where she was struggling against the line.*
>
>*"W-water..." - she says, breathing heavily - "Please..."*

You found a little fairy, take good care of her (or torture her, I don't care).
