### [Traditional](#writers)

#### [Clark Ashton Smith](https://files.catbox.moe/ezoai8.module)

[by ☄WanderingStar](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/941647194845483018)

*Pure, 100%, unadulterated Clark Ashton Smith. Prose only, no poetry, mostly very short-form fiction. Expect exotic locales and fanciful character names. Somewhat archaic diction and a more verbose style with longer sentences. A tendency to develop narrative rather quickly after initial set-up due to prevalence of short-form fiction. Darker themes generally but also capable of a light touch with the right prompt.*

***Tags:** Fantasy, cosmic horror, gothic, short stories, single-author, style-oriented.*

***Sources:** Volumes 1-5 of his collected stories (excluding the juvenalia, vol. 6). 80% coverage, 3.01 loss (perhaps the exotic names are to be blamed for this, but it is still quite coherent).*

>The night was very black, and the stars were hidden by a pall of smoke that hung over the city like a cloud. The air was full of ashes; and in the streets there was no sound but the rattle of wheels on the pavement, and the low murmur of voices from the open windows of the houses. It seemed to me that I had never seen such an empty-looking place before, nor heard so many doors shut at once; and I thought it strange that all should be quiet when the whole world was in tumult. But then I remembered that this was not a time for people to go abroad except in disguise or under cover of darkness. And as we came nearer the palace, I saw that the gates were closed, and the guards posted within their portals. They looked at us with fixed eyes through the gloom, and did not move until we had passed them.
>
>We went up the broad steps of the great portico, which was lit by torches placed upon brackets along its sides. We entered the building without being challenged; and after passing through several large rooms, we found ourselves in a smaller hall whose walls were hung with tapestries of gold and silver, and whose floor was paved with marble slabs. There was no one about, save a few slaves who carried lamps into other parts of the house.
>
>At last we reached a door of carved wood, and knocked softly upon it. A voice answered us from within: "Who comes?"
>
>"It is the Prince," said my father.
>
>A moment later a man opened the door, and admitted us. He was tall and thin, and wore a robe of purple velvet embroidered with golden threads.

>The necromancer's face was a mask of horror. He had been expecting something like this, but not quite so soon; and he felt that his own powers were failing him in the presence of such an evil influence as this. His voice trembled with fear when he spoke to the corpse-man: "What is your will? What do you desire?"
>
>"I want to be taken back," said the dead man, "to my place of rest."
>
>"You shall have it!" cried the necromancer, seizing the body by the arms and dragging it from the bed. The thing seemed to weigh no more than a child; and its limbs moved stiffly under his hands as if they were made of wood or stone.
>
>"Where are we going?" asked the dead man, as he followed after his master into the corridor.
>
>"To the tomb chamber," answered the necromancer.
>
>They went down many winding stairs, and through dark passages which led them farther and farther away from the house of the sorcerer. At length they came to a huge vaulted room whose walls were covered with frescoes of death and desolation. The floor was strewn with bones and skulls, and here and there lay the corpses of men and women who had died long ago. In the center of the chamber stood a sarcophagus, and on top of it rested a skeleton clad in black armor and carrying a sword and shield. This figure was the necromancer himself.

*I've trained my CS Lewis module for Euterpe V2. Tested and seems to be working extremely well, his style comes through much more strongly than it did with Sigurd.*

*Training data is most of Lewis's fiction: Narnia books, Space Trilogy, Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, Til We Have Faces, Pilgim's Regress. Plus a small selection of non-fiction works: Mere Christianity, The Four Loves, The Weight of Glory.*

#### [George Orwell](https://files.catbox.moe/twyx0p.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371627864)

*Someone suggested to do this as a module. Done.*

*ZIP file contains the module, the training data, the image, and the base for the training data I formatted. So if at some point [Euterpe V3] or [20] beaks or whatever the fuck comes out and I'm not there to retrain the modules, you'll have everything you need.*

*A module trained on several works by Italian author Italo Calvino (originally made for Sigurd, updated for Euterpe V2)*

***Tags:** literature, fiction, good prose*

>Here was the city that I loved. Nothing could be clearer and more impressive than its ancient majesty, with high ramparts towering in every direction over paved stone roads bordered by fine wrought iron streetlamps... it took my breath away! I went toward a restaurant called The Black Diamond in Plaza del Mascaras at two o'clock sharp. When I entered, the air smelled of garlic and oil; tables were set out on an enormous marble floor under vaulted ceilings decorated with frescoes showing scenes from Roman history and classical mythologies—a huge dining room indeed! Some people passed through: well dressed ladies wearing little black hats whose creases told their owners how many times they had been removed. There sat at one table Clara Cardellini eating spinach soup and crumb cake while her husband Giannis licked butter off his knife's tip. Next to them old Jocasta Doria drank straight-from-the-jug wine as she ate meatballs followed by red pears sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. On another side of the big square, sitting at a large round table surrounded by half-dressed waiters, was the great industrialist Eusebio Astrada y Gómez drinking something made out of potatoes he'd just bought at a nearby market stall for six pesetas apiece. And then there stood Antonio Marcelino, who owned the largest shipyard on the Spanish Main. His friend Carlos Paredes sipped champagne out of glasses shaped like cherries that seemed almost too small to contain such a powerful beverage.

*A module trained on The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit books, for Euterpe.*

***Tags:** LOTR, Hobbit, Fantasy, Tolkien*

*Sources: The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit books

*This is a retrain of an existing module that was considerably cleaned up, trained to one epoch. There are some odd formatting issues with quotes but the issues are considerably less than the old module.*

***Final Loss:** 2.64*

#### [Jorge Luis Borges](https://files.catbox.moe/yekhfs.module)

[by Chr0nicler](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/943199484081475674)

*An experimental module trained on all short stories by Jorge Luis Borges, uses the translation he personally collaborated on.*

*My first module; trained at 100%*

#### [P. G. Wodehouse](https://files.catbox.moe/8781qt.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371553491)

*PG Wodehouse Euterpe V2 module, trained to 50.14% with 4100 steps.*

*Trained on 22 full novels and collections; 608,000+ words.*

*Much Obliged, Jeeves, The Inimitable Jeeves, Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, Right Ho Jeeves, Jeeves in the Offing, My Man Jeeves, The Man with Two Left Feet, The Girl on the Boat, Psmith in the City, Three Men and a Maid, Tales of St. Austin’s, The Adventures of Sally, The Clicking of Cuthbert, The Prince and Betty, The Gold Bat, The Coming Of Bill, The Little Nugget, Something New, Spring Fever, Mike and Psmith, Not George Washington , Love Among The Chickens*

#### [Rod Serling](https://files.catbox.moe/q2nzv7.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371610961)

*Alright, I'm going to be retraining my modules for Euterpe over the course of the day. Here's the first one: The Rod Serling module.*

*Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the module, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/372882609/#372946605)

*I retrained the Kinky Friedman module for Euterpe. Also went through the data set again first and fixed a few problems I found.*

*Books included are: Greenwich Killing Time, A Case of Lone Star, When The Cat's Away, Frequent Flyer, Musical Chairs, Elvis Jesus & Coca-Cola, Armadillos & Old Lace, God Bless John Wayne, The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover, Roadkill, Blast From The Past, Steppin On A Rainbow, Curse of the Missing Puppet Head, Ten Little New Yorkers, Spanking Watson, The Prisoner of Vandam Street, Kill Two Birds & Get Stoned, The Christmas Pig: A Fable, The Mile High Club*

>The next day I was in my office when McGovern came by. The windows were open and the air smelled like a New York City garbage dump, but it felt good to be back in the city after so long on the road. There were signs of spring all around me – birds chirping outside the window, flowers blooming in the yard, and even the cat had stopped hissing at me. As he walked in, McGovern said, "I've got some news for you."
>
>"Any good?" I asked hopefully.
>
>"There's been a murder," he replied with a grim look.
>
>My heart sank. It seemed that every time I'd thought we'd gotten out of trouble, something else would rear up and throw itself into the fray. My hopes for a quiet little life were not coming true. In fact, there didn't seem to be any way I could ever get out from under the constant burden of trying to find a missing person or a murderer.

[25% coverage version](https://files.catbox.moe/g1area.module)

*Trained on Antony Beevor's WW2 Histories at 50% and 25%. Works include Ardennes, Arnhem, Stalingrad, The Battle for Spain, The Fall of Berlin and The Second World War. I made two hoping that 25% would be better for different settings but both seem to lean heavy on WW2 anyway. The style is highly detailed so outputs are often going to include names of specific units, generals, location, weapons, vehicles etc.*

***Tags:** 3rd Person War History, WW2*

*Frocto: 7632 steps, 80% AVG Loss: 3.03*

>**A glistening black carapace slithered sensuously through the shadows of a narrow corridor.** The creature's long, sinuous body moved with fluid grace and it was difficult to believe that such an elegant form could be so deadly. But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And what one man finds beautiful another might find hideous—and vice versa.
>
>The alien paused at the corner where two corridors intersected. It turned its head slightly toward the left-hand passage and made no move to go down that way. Instead, it continued along the right side, pausing now and then as if listening for something. When nothing came from this direction either, it went on into the darkness ahead. There were sounds coming from there, too: muffled voices, footsteps echoing off metal walls. The alien did not stop but crept forward slowly, carefully, like a cat hunting mice.
>
>At last the alien reached the end of the passageway. Here it stopped once more, crouching low against the wall and holding itself motionless. Then, without warning, it launched itself across the gap between the two corridors and landed softly behind three men who had been talking quietly together when they heard the sound. One of them whirled around just as the alien struck him in the back of his neck with one powerful claw. He dropped instantly to the floor, dead before he hit. Another man tried to turn away from the attack but found himself caught by the claws that tore out his throat. Blood gushed forth in a crimson flood. The third man screamed and fell to the ground, trying desperately to roll aside from the grasping arms that pinned him to the decking.

>**"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I** took an arrow in the knee,” is a common saying among most Khajiit. The phrase refers to the fact that, for all their agility and stealthy ways, they are ill-equipped physically to survive a protracted campaign against hostile creatures. As such, though many Khajiit may be found adventuring (even as far away as Skyrim), more often than not they find themselves engaged in some kind of trade or activity which involves less risk to life and limb.

>**When in Morrowind, do** as the Daedra do. When your character is a Daedric Prince, you know this to be true. The Daedric Princes are experts at how they live their lives — and how we should all live ours. After all, if it were not for Daedra, there would be no Daedric Princes! And where would they be without us?
>
>These few simple rules should help you get started on the path toward becoming the best version of yourself possible:
>
>1\. Be honest with your friends and your family. If someone asks you what you’re doing with your life, answer honestly: “I am a Daedric Prince who is exploring new lands and having fun.” Don’t lie about it like I did when my parents asked me why I was playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim so much.

>**"Hey Alduin,"** I said, “would you mind sharing your cave with me?”
>
>Alduin was still a little mad at me because of the time when I had taken his favorite cave and turned it into an inn. He was sitting in front of his cave looking sad and lonely. I could tell that he really needed some company right now and he looked like he would be glad to have mine. So I went over to him.
>
>“Howdy there, big fella!” I said. “I know we haven’t always gotten along but I don’t mean any harm by this...”
>
>He grunted at me but didn’t say anything. I took a deep breath and started talking again, hoping to calm him down, “Look, Alduin, you were just so beautiful and scary and awesome that I couldn’t resist showing off by trying to steal your cave from you. It was all my fault, really, so why don’t you let me stay here for awhile until I can come up with something better?”
>
>The dragon sighed deeply and slowly shook his head. But then he gave me a look that made me feel like maybe he wasn’t quite as angry anymore.
>
>“Fine,” he said, “but if you cause even one bit of trouble, I will eat you.”
>
>“That won’t be necessary,” I told him. “If you promise not to go on a rampage or destroy anything, I will leave everything exactly where it is. As long as you don’t eat anyone who comes through here, I think we can both be happy."

>**Here's a list of Sheogorath's best quotations:**
>
>**1\.** “I am the god of insanity and chaos, but I have not forsaken you. My madness is your salvation!”
>
>2\. “My minions are the stars in my sky... and I will take them all down into darkness with me.”
>
>3\. “The world has been mine since time began! The gods are dead. You mortals are nothing more than an annoying distraction to me as I await the coming of Oblivion.”
>
>4\. “Do not fear for the future. It is already written... and it is written in blood.”

>**Leaving Neverwinter, the dwarf Magnus Bigpuffer reflected on his journey north, to Luskan.** In truth he had done nothing more than follow the trail of gold and gems. That was enough for him. He was a dwarf, after all, and dwarves did not often ask why they took this path or that; instead they simply followed their noses. But now that he was here, in Luskan, it was time to make some sense of things.

>*I looked through the window of* my office, taking in the sights. The crowd had thinned out considerably since I'd last checked on it, but there were still plenty of people on the streets. It's not like I could just close the curtains and pretend that those people didn't exist... No, if anything, I should be glad I have a job where I can help them while I'm at it.
>
>The Nest wasn't really all that big. My boss only had me look after one office, so all I needed to do was check up on it every few hours. That way, I figured I wouldn't get tired too easily.
>
>"Hm? Oh! There you are!"
>
>This time, the voice came from behind me. I turned around and saw my co-worker walking towards me with a smile on his face. He was pretty strong for someone who had such a small body, so he often picked up some of the more heavier items our customers brought in.
>
>"Hey, what brings you here today?"
>
>He gave me a pat on the shoulder before answering. "Just checking up on you." Then he pointed out into the distance. "You know how crowded it is outside right now, right?"
>
>I nodded as I took another glance at the street outside. Yeah, I knew. When I first started working in this Nest, it was much quieter than it was now. But I guess over time, word got around about the good work we did, and now the Nest was busier than ever. I couldn't complain, though. Our customers were always grateful when they left here, and we got to keep working without having to worry about being kicked out by our landlord.
>
>"Yeah, you're right," I said. "So what about it?"
>
>"Well, I heard that some guy came in earlier saying he wanted to hire us for an important job, something along those lines..."

>"I don't want to be a burden. I'm not asking you for anything."
>
>She was lying on the bed in her room, wearing nothing but an oversized T-shirt and shorts. A puddle of sweat had formed beneath her head. Her cheeks were flushed red from the heat—the same color as her hair.
>
>Her voice was so calm that it didn't seem like she was trying to convince him at all. She sounded like she knew what she wanted. Like she already had everything figured out and there was no more need to pretend. It made me feel uneasy just listening to her talk about money.
>
>But... I guess she's right. I'll pay whatever we need, if it means making her happy.
>
>I thought I was going to have to say something about how much money we needed, but before I could even open my mouth, she spoke up again:
>
>"Do you know why I joined this job?"
>
>I shook my head. "No."
>
>"It's because I couldn't take any more of what they did to me when I was younger. Because I never got any better after that. And now, it's come back around and bit me in the ass again."
>
>"What do you mean?"
>
>"The Syndicate is the only place that will hire me, so I can't get myself off their hook by doing something illegal or getting arrested."

>**Like a shark through dark waters, the shadowy figure slipped through the night with predatory grace**. The streetlights and neon signs of downtown Baltimore blinked out behind it as it moved quickly down one side street after another. It had been more than two weeks since the last time it had fed—and even that meager meal had left its taste in its mouth like ashes on the tongue. There was no reason to think tonight would be any different; but still, there were times when hunger could not be denied. And so, for now, it continued moving along without pause or rest until it found what it sought.
>
>The streets grew emptier as the creature traveled deeper into the city's heart. Soon only a few scattered pedestrians wandered about their business by lamplight. One man hurried across the street at an intersection, oblivious to the fact that he might have been struck dead instantly if his path had crossed that of the predator stalking him from around the corner. A woman paused before a convenience store window, staring inside longingly while her purse hung casually over her shoulder. Another woman sat alone at a table outside a coffee shop, reading a book as she sipped from a cup of steaming liquid. Her eyes flicked up occasionally, but never once did they meet those of the creature watching her from the shadows. She paid little attention to anything except the words on the page in front of her.
>
>It waited patiently, almost leisurely, for several minutes longer. When the woman finally closed her book and stood, leaving her chair empty beside the table, the creature took action. It moved silently through the shadows toward her. As it drew closer, the woman looked up suddenly, startled by the sudden movement. She tried to turn away, but too late. In a flash, the creature leapt forward and grabbed her arm, yanking her to the ground. Before she knew what was happening, she was face-to-face with its fangs. The woman screamed and fought against the thing holding her, trying to get free. But it held fast, pressing her head back into the wet pavement beneath them both. Its grip tightened, and the woman cried out again. The creature leaned close, letting her feel the heat of its breath on her skin. "Don't struggle," it whispered in a voice like death itself.

*A first shot at a module based on Middle Eastern folklore and imaginative fantasy stories with compatible settings inspired by the region's folktales and history. I opted not to include excerpts from/the entire 1001 Nights itself this time round but I will probably revisit the theme with a narrower and more “classical Arabian folklore” focus eventually. You will probably want to downbias the token “Ç” as there is a character whose name begins with this letter and who is unfortunately over-represented in this set.*

>The city was a riot of color. It was a city that never slept, with its streets full of people and the sounds of music coming from every direction: the sound of a drumbeat in one alley, the singing of an old woman somewhere else; a young girl's laughter echoing down another street, and the shouts of a crowd at some distant point. He had heard all this before on his visits to Cairo, but now he saw it through different eyes. The colors were brighter, more intense—he felt as if he could reach out and pluck them from the air and turn them into something tangible. In the distance there came the clink of metal against metal and then the faintest cry of pain. There were people everywhere: children playing in the dirt by the side of the road, beggars sleeping in doorways or sitting up against walls, women carrying baskets on their heads, men with their hands full of goods. And all the time they were laughing, shouting, talking loudly and laughing louder still when someone laughed at their joke.

>The desert was cool beneath the night sky and the air was still, so much so that there were no clouds in sight. The moon was a thin crescent and its light seemed to spill over the dunes like blood spilling from an open wound, or like a cloud of ink spilled on a cloth. I walked through the desert, with only the sound of my footsteps breaking the silence of the night to accompany me. And though I felt nothing at all, I continued walking, as if my body was driven by some instinct of self-preservation. For it was the hour of the ghouls.

>The desert wind picked up, rustling the palms and blowing sand into his eyes. He wiped them and looked down at the old woman. "You have to tell me something."
>
>"Yes," she said. "I will tell you this: a man's life is like a candle flame that flickers in the wind, but if it burns for long enough, it can burn down to the very end of the world."
>
>She fell silent again, and he waited, holding his breath, listening to the wind. He'd never had much patience. It was one of the things he disliked about himself. He needed to know now, right now, what was going on. The old woman sighed and said, "My husband's name was Rashid al-Khoury, and I loved him more than anything in the world. He was a good man, a kind man, a man who would give you his last coin if you asked for it. When we were young, he had a terrible temper, and we quarreled often. But as we grew older, it calmed down. We shared everything. And then my son was born. We named him Ali, after his father. He was beautiful, like his father, and I loved him too." She paused, and then continued, her voice barely above a whisper. "And then one day, he went out to work in the fields with my brother, and he never came back.

>The next day the two armies met, and the battle was fought.
>
>It was a long and bloody encounter, for it lasted till evening. The Britons had their spears and swords, and they had armour made of boiled leather; but the Saxons had shields made of wood, and were armed with steel helmets on their heads. Now this helmet was made by melting the iron from the sword blades which had been broken in battle.
>
>They had other weapons besides these: for they had bows with arrows of iron, and slings which they used to throw stones from the ground up into the sky and let them fall like hail upon the Britons' heads. And at the head of them all was Alweo, the Saxon chief. He wore a helmet of iron, and he had an axe in his hand. As he marched through the ranks of the enemy, he shouted in a loud voice, "Come forth and fight with me! Come forth and die!"
>
>Then all the warriors of Britain heard him shout thus, and they answered him: "Thou shalt not be slain. We will fight thee on the plain, and then thou shalt flee away."

>And when they drew near to a clump of bushes that stood near the edge of the wood, behold! they saw before them an old woman sitting with her back towards them, at the foot of an oak; and she was making a kindling fire on a little knoll which had grown up among the rocks and stones of the ground.
>
>The King and his company halted; and the King called out: "What is thy name? Who art thou?"
>
>The old woman rose from her seat as if she were coming hither, but she said no word in answer to the King's question, and sat down again again by the oak.
>
>"What are ye doing there, grandmother?" said the King.
>
>But she only looked round upon him without speaking; and her eyes were red, and blood trickled from them. And he asked her again: "Who art thou? What dost thou here?"
>
>Then she answered: "I am a witch; and I sit here because this is the place whither all witches go."
>
>Then the King saw that she had spoken truly.
>
>He turned to his companions and said: "See that this is indeed a witch, and not some madwoman. We should slay her at once."
>
>"I do not know," said another. "This old woman is very ill, or she would not sit here thus, and stare before us in that way. She may be a witch, yet mayhap we should do better to spare her."

*A module trained on the first two volumes of 18 Japanese light novels + 3 one-shots about high school life & romance, with a small hint of yuri and the supernatural mixed in. Mostly first person male pov, maybe otherwise with the yuri material.

>The second day of the club was the first time we had a proper conversation. After that, my heart started beating faster whenever I saw her.
>
>However, there were no more incidents like yesterday, so things seemed to be going well for us today, at least. The reason I could enjoy this moment without feeling anxious was probably thanks to the fact that I'd already seen her in action yesterday. She wasn't just good at looking after students and being kind; she even took care of other people's problems too!
>
>"Today is going to be the last day before summer vacation, right? We should have an event or something!" Iroha suggested while we were cleaning up the room.
>
>"What do you mean?" I asked.
>
>"Like a sports tournament or something. That would get everyone pumped up for summer break!"
>
>"...You're pretty enthusiastic about all this, huh?"
>
>"A-Are you calling me weird?!"
>
>It's not that big of a deal though...
>
>I had a few ideas, but putting them into practice didn't seem feasible, so I couldn't come up with anything else. However, Iroha seemed to have been thinking really hard about it, and soon enough came up with the perfect idea. "Oh yeah! Why don't we make a photo contest?! Everyone can take pictures of each other and submit them to our club bulletin board!"
>
>"...That sounds great," I replied with a nod, which made Iroha smile happily.
>
>"Yay! This'll be so fun! You should join in on the photo contest, Senpai!"
>
>"Uh, sure..."
>
>When I agreed, Iroha suddenly hugged me tightly. Oh crap, she caught me off guard! I quickly pushed her away. "...Umm...what are you doing?"
>
>"...I'm sorry! I was just happy that you agreed with my idea!"
>
>Her smile was bright as always, and her eyes sparkled in excitement.
>
>It reminded me of that picture of the girl on TV. Iroha looked like she was having a blast, and I felt myself getting dragged along to play with her.

>The next morning, as the sun rose over the mountains of northern Xinan, I stood with the others in my new household. In a moment, a horseman galloped up to the gates and dismounted. The man bowed, his eyes on me. "I am Jin Wang. I have been sent by your father." He spoke the tongue of our homeland. His words were clipped and precise, without the accent of the Goryeo or the southern Han that had crept into my own speech.
>
>"I'm very sorry. Please tell him we are all well. That is, we're all alive," I added hastily, remembering the men who had ridden out to meet them.
>
>in Wang nodded curtly. "You must go quickly. Your father's soldiers have camped three leagues north of here. They will be coming soon."
>
>I stared at him, bewildered. "How could they get that far ahead of us?"

>The night was dark and starless. The moon, obscured by clouds, had not risen. He stood before the entrance of a temple on a hilltop near the river. A great bronze bell hung from a thick rope in the middle of the roof, and he watched the mist gather at its base. It had been a long day: he'd ridden to the city, then gone with the other men to see the dead body of one of their own, whose wife he had been sent to protect. He had watched as the embalmer and his assistants took the man apart, washing him, scraping off the dried blood, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, until nothing remained but bones, which they wrapped carefully in silk. Then it was time to dress the corpse and take up his coffin, and stand beside it for three days and nights while the bells rang mournfully, summoning the faithful to pray for his soul, or whatever the soul might be called on its journey after death.

>"It is time for the seventh moon of the winter season," said the Jade Emperor. "The three brothers must choose a wife from among all those who have presented themselves to them."
>
>The princes looked at one another in consternation.
>
>"I do not understand this rule," said Zhu Cong. "We are supposed to be choosing wives, but they must first choose wives for us."
>
>"Of course," answered the Jade Emperor. "They need to know which of you is worthy and which of you should be exiled."
>
>The princes turned to look at the princesses. They were all beautiful, young, and well-born—but it was clear that some were better than others. Some had more beauty and grace than others; some were more accomplished in music or poetry or martial arts; some seemed more intelligent than others; some were simply kinder and more generous. The princely brothers did not like any of them.

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** and the gulls wheeled about her in a strange and ungraspable dance. And as they circled they saw beneath her the mermaid's arms were stretched out wide upon the sea, and her hands were empty: but the palms of her hands were covered with blood.
>
>And as the gulls cried out across the ocean to each other: "What is this?" one answered: "I have seen it before—in a dream." And then another said: "It is the time when the mermaid sleeps, and dreams of her lover." And yet another: "That is why we do not eat human flesh; for we know that the spirit sleeps, and that if we kill it, its soul shall come forth again from the grave."
>
>Then one of them cried out: "We are birds of sorrowful heart, for our hearts are heavy with sadness and grief." And all the birds, wherever they flew, sang together, and the mermaid slept.

>
>I woke to voices outside my window and looked out through the bars. A witch was there, a woman with skin like bronze, hair as dark as an owl's feathers. I could see she wasn't alone—there were other women standing behind her, all of them looking at me with hunger in their eyes. They were young, old, tall, short; they wore peasant dresses or gowns of fine linen; some held babies in their arms while others carried baskets on their backs. They were all different races, from all over the world—but they looked like sisters.
>
>"Alessia?" the witch asked me. "Is that you?"
>
>I realized then that I must have fallen asleep, curled up in my bed, and dreamed that she'd come for me. I wanted to tell her no, but I couldn't find my voice.
>
>The witch smiled, and I saw her face change from her own, to mine. And then she laughed, and said, "Oh, how lovely, dear girl."
>
>They all laughed then, as she led me down the stairs to meet them.

*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

>**Morgan's brows furrowed, and he stared** down at the book. "You're sure? She was in there?"

>"No, I'm pretty sure that's just what happens when the world ends," the rabbit said. "A poem—it says 'when winter draws in'—but I don't know how winter is drawing in."
>
>"Yes, well, that might be because the book doesn't seem to make any sense," Alice said. "It's written in a sort of code. It says something about a maze, and there's all these dots and things and lines crossed out and words that aren't even spelled right. I've tried to decipher it, but there are too many letters with multiple meanings. For example, it looks like the word 'moon' has more than one meaning. See, it says 'the moon is shining bright.' And then it also says 'and the moon moves farther from the earth.' And 'night,' and 'nighttime' and 'nightmare' and 'dreaming' and 'nightmares' and 'nightmares' and...well, you can see that it gets a little confusing."
>
>The rabbit smiled. "I don't think it is meant to make sense," he said.
>
>"Well, I still don't understand it," Alice said, glancing at the clock.

>**Once upon a time**, there was a very rich man who had four sons. The younger three were selfish and lazy. They did not like to work at all. They thought their father's money would continue to fall from the sky, so they did nothing but sit in their rooms reading books and making music all day long.
>
>One day, a beggar came up to them and asked for some food.
>
>The first son said, "Why should I feed you? You are a dirty old man."
>
>The second son said, "You have no manners. Get away from here, beggar!"
>
>The third son said, "I don't care what you think of me, but if my brothers give you food, then it is as good as mine."
>
>So he gave the beggar some food too. The beggar thanked him and left.
>Then the older brother said, "Now we will see whether our father really loves us or not."
>
>And they all sat down to wait. Soon after that, the eldest brother died, and soon after that the second brother died, and soon after that the youngest brother also died, and just when the oldest son was about to die, his coffin broke open. All his gold fell out onto the ground.
>Then the richest man in the kingdom saw this and said, "Here is a strange thing! If the dead brothers did not need any food, how could the eldest son die?"

*This is an update of my Sword and Sorcery module, remade for Euterpe v2!*

***TAGS:** sword and sorcery, conan the barbarian, kull, red sonja, kane*

*Authors encompass pretty much every major Sword and Sorcery pastiche author except Robert E. Howard (as he deserves his own module).*

>**The barbarian** saw a dim light ahead as they walked through the darkness. At last he found a door set in the wall and pulled it open to reveal a room brightly lit by torches. The chamber was quite large, with a high ceiling that rose above his head. A dozen or more people moved about, talking among themselves and busily preparing food. They were all of the same race, for each man wore the same dark-green robes as Kane. The barbarian recognized several of them from the party at the palace.
>
>"What are these people?" he asked.
>
>Kane looked back over his shoulder, and saw his two companions seated on a bench beside him.
>
>"These are members of the cult," he said. "They wear the robes for identification."
>
>"So I see," Conan said, eyeing the people with distaste. He had never been comfortable around so many strangers. The way they stared at him gave him a chill feeling.
>
>A balding man with a round face approached Kane and stood before him. He spoke in a low voice.
>
>"I am Father Kavo. You have brought your friends here safely, and I thank you for that. Would you care for some food? We have meat and fruit and wine to offer you."
>
>Conan shook his head, and Kavo smiled. He led them down a corridor to another room.

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371552753)

*Updated the WW1 module for Euterpe*

> \>what went into this?

*Autism. Autism went into that, along with All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, A Storm of Steel by Ernst Jünger, Under Fire by Henri Barbusse , poems by Wilfred Own, Infantry Attacks by Rommel, and more.*<br>
*Basically first person past tense accounts of infantry on the western front, both historical and fictional to hopefully give an impression of the horrors of early 20th century combat and the disaffected ruined youth of that generation.*

*I'll probably eventually whip up editions for the east, Italian front, and air combat.*

*Yee haw! This module focuses on the Western Romance genre, but is leavened out by ordinary Westerns. LGBT and People of Color perspectives were also added in. Have fun roundin' them all up!*

>**She rode, and rode after the love of her life**, but he had already gone west. Her heart was broken and she cried for days, weeks, and months. She vowed to follow him and bring him back.
>
>The long winter months passed quickly for her. It wasn't so much the cold that bothered her as it was knowing that there would be no more joy in the warmth of his arms. There was no comfort in this cold season, only a longing for the man who stole her heart.
>
>On Christmas Day, she was awakened by the sound of hooves on the frozen ground. For a moment, she thought it was a dream—the memory of another time and place when they were together. She rose from the bed and walked softly downstairs to investigate. The horses were harnessed up to the wagon and ready to go. She had not seen the wagon in the yard since before she left Texas. He was coming home to her!
>
>"It's too early," she whispered to herself. "He will be here at midnight, or even later." She slipped out the back door and headed toward the barn. As she crossed the yard, she noticed a faint glow of light in the barn window.
>
>"Is he here?" she wondered. She drew nearer. No one answered, but she could see a lantern hanging inside the barn. She felt a little foolish sneaking into the barn, but she was so excited, she couldn't help herself. She hurried inside and found him in the loft, fast asleep. He looked so handsome and peaceful. She smiled as she saw the quilt thrown over his legs.
>
>He stirred at the sound of her voice. His eyes opened slowly. Then, with a start, he recognized her.
>
>"Oh, my God! What are you doing here?" He tried to sit up but quickly fell back onto the hay. "I am sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. But it is so good to see you again."
>
>"It's good to see you again, too," she said softly. She crawled across the loft to join him, careful not to make any noise. His body was warm under the quilt and he felt so right.
>
>"It has been too long," he said. "I have missed you."

*Trained on AO3 fics that star Cynthia from Pokemon (since I spent a lot of time with that card of her). Unfortunately, it's pretty mundane stuff, but I was already too far in when I realized that. Trained at 90%.*

*I retrained my Female Wrestling module for Euterpe. I hope you enjoy it (why V3 instead of V2? Because I kept V2 for myself; it was trained with more stories than V1).*

*Try writing "X vs X" and you might get a good detailed match.*

*Trained on a few fanfics from "Wanna be the strongest in the world" and Rumble Roses. Mostly 3rd person, past tense.*

*Since I wasn't able to train anything today, here's an another test module instead. Catbirds. Got some positive feedback for this in Sigurd, so might as well publish it. Trained at ~40% of 20 MB of gryphon/griffin fiction, mostly the ones that feature them as protagonists. (I was testing how well Euterpe handles beaks, quadrupeds, etc.)*<br>
*May have got overtrained with some names, despite not even being 50%. Easily biased, though.*<br>

***Steps:** 9250*

***Loss:** 2.68*

***Tags:** gryphons, fantasy, urban fantasy, other fantasy creatures too, but mostly gryphons*

*Trained with a mix of LitRPG novels, too many to list. This was made as a test module, but since it seems to work, might as well share it. Uses the ─  for LitRPG stat blocks and other game-elements. If you already know what LitRPG is, you know what to expect. If not... read the sample.*

>**The chest opened with a creak. Inside** lay an orb, carved from black crystal. The sphere was roughly the size of a soccer ball and seemed to be made of solid obsidian. I reached for it, then hesitated as the words appeared on my display:
>
>─ Skill Acquired! You have acquired "Mysteries of the Ancient Realm" through the Orb of Knowledge! This skill grants you access to additional quests, and gives you the ability to interact with certain aspects of the realm that cannot be accessed directly without its aid.
>
>A small line of text appeared below the Skill Acquired prompt:
>
>─ Title Acquired: Mystery Breaker! Title received for completing "Quest for the Orb."
>
>I had gotten titles before. Some were simple achievements like "Scribe in Training," or "Learned" (in reference to learning new skills), common titles that I had seen others earn along their way into becoming full-fledged adventurers. This one, though, was something different entirely, something new, something special...
>
>For some reason, seeing a title like this filled me with pride.
>
>The title reminded me of how far I'd come since becoming trapped in this strange world. When I first found myself here, I felt like I was fighting against my fate, but now I could see things differently. The path forward may have been unclear at first, but as time passed and more things fell into place, I began to understand that this wasn't just some random game that would end soon; I was living in another reality, a fantasy land where anything was possible. That realization made all the difference. It gave me the courage to fight back. To take control of my own destiny.

*Trained on approximately 50 horror shorts and series that focus on sinister anomalies in the natural world.*

***Tags:** Horror, nature, creepypasta*

>**The deer looked...strange, like someone had tried to imagine the animal from memory.** It stood there, swaying slightly as it watched me intently, and I saw that its head was too large for its body: two huge antlers jutted up above its ears, and the legs were thin, almost skeletal with small hooves that clacked loudly on the hard earth of the forest floor.
>
>The eyes were very bright, and they did not blink, and it seemed to stare at me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.
>
>I froze in fear, unable to move, as this strange deer kept watching me and began walking slowly towards me.
>
>My brain, normally so quick, had shut down; all I could think about was running away from this thing, but I couldn't move my feet.

*Trained on various tsundere character dialogue from a variety of different series. Use this to imbue any character with a tsundere personality.*

*Source material is too varied to list.*

>The girl pouted. "I didn't mean it like that, all right?!" she said defensively.
>
>"No? But I'm sure you're thinking it," the boy replied with a smirk, making her blush even more deeply.
>
>"You...you...!" The girl was about to say something else when she noticed there were other people nearby. She quickly got up and moved away from him before they could notice them together. "Hmph!"

>**The alien girl with tentacles approached me, and my eyes were arrested** by the beauty of her face. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. The human man standing next to me became aware of the situation and looked at me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I felt a slight shiver of embarrassment from him. He didn't know me, but he was looking at me as if I was an animal.
>
>The alien girl was smiling at me, and it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my body. It felt like a great wave was coming from her, and it washed over me with all of its power. My heart was beating faster, and I couldn't stop staring at her. She looked like she could be my own daughter, or maybe my sister. There was such a strong sense of family between us that we would have been related somehow.
>
>"Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuchi, and I am an alien from another planet," the girl said. "You must be one of those humans that I read about."
>
>"Yes. I'm a human," I replied.
>
>"I can tell that you are a very intelligent creature. Your mind is much more developed than many others," she said.
>
>"Thank you for your compliment. We don't hear them very often," I answered.
>
>She giggled, and I realized that she was talking to me like we had known each other for a long time. There was a sense of familiarity between us. Her tentacles swayed slowly back and forth, and they were trying to pull me in closer to her. As she moved them, I got the feeling that I was being pulled toward her in the same way. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't do it. It wasn't right to do that with someone who wasn't human. I could feel her warmth through our connection. She was so warm, and I couldn't resist her pull.
>"Come with me," she said.
>
>As I followed her, I felt like I was leaving behind everyone and everything that I knew.

>**The succubus laughed and approached me with her hips swaying**. She was wearing a tight black dress that clung to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. She had on a long silk drape that was tied around her neck but fell off one shoulder and down the opposite side of her torso. Her long hair was tied back and flowed down her back in a black waterfall. I could see the tattoo of an angel on her chest as it swam out from under her dress. "I have some news for you." The succubus spoke seductively.
>
>"That is not how we do things," I told her sternly.
>
>"You will be my toy for a year or until I am finished with you," she replied as if she knew what was going through my head. "I don't need your permission for anything."
>
>"This is unacceptable! You are not even my mistress yet!" I said angrily.
>The succubus bent over and pulled down on the front of her dress. She let it fall off her shoulders and it fell all the way to the floor. She stood up again, exposing herself completely. Her nipples were hard and her breasts jiggled with every move she made.
>
>"Are you happy?" she asked looking at me defiantly.
>
>"No, I'm not," I replied. My heart started racing as I looked at her perfect body.
>
>"Then be quiet and play with your new body," she said as she walked over to me.
>
>I felt my dick start to stir as she got closer. The succubus sat on the edge of the table and spread her legs wide. She pushed her tits together and slid her hand between them. Her fingers moved quickly as they circled her nipples. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned in pleasure.
>
>"I am so wet right now," she whispered as her hand disappeared into her pussy. She wiggled her hips as she pumped her hand furiously.
>
>She leaned forward and looked at me. "Do you want to feel this?"
>
>I nodded my head and reached out to touch her. Her skin was silky smooth and warm against my palm. When I touched her, she shivered with pleasure. I watched her lick her lips as I rubbed her pussy. She opened her thighs wider, allowing me better access.

>*The wolf man approached me, his arousal already evident, knot swelling.* He seemed to be waiting for something before he made any further moves.
>
>"I don't understand," I said. "What is it you want?"
>
>He smiled, flashing his teeth. "You have the scent of a woman on your lips, my dear. And the taste of one in your mouth." His fingers trailed over my cheek and down the side of my neck. "And the feel of another inside you, yes?" He licked at my earlobe, then bit down hard enough to draw blood. I yelped and pressed closer to him.
>
>"Yes, it's true," I said. "I've done that with someone. A man. It was wonderful."
>
>"Then you must give me what he didn't." The wolf-man leaned forward, his hand sliding from my hip to my thigh. His palm spread against my skin as his fingers curled under the hem of my dress. My breath caught as his hand slid upward until it rested right below my ass. I shivered as his fingers grazed the bare skin there. "Will you allow me to do this for you? Please?"
>
>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
>
>His hand slid up my leg, slipping beneath the skirt of my dress. The wolf-man's fingertips brushed against my cunt, sending little ripples through me. His other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me tight against him. I felt his hard cock press between us, but he held me away from him.
>
>"Tell me, sweet girl, if you would like me to touch you there." He ran the tip of his finger along the seam of my pussy. "Or do you prefer that I just lick you and make you come for me?"
>
>I moaned when he pressed two fingers inside me. His thumb rubbed against my clit. "Do it," I breathed. "Lick me. Make me come."
>
>The wolf-man licked at my pussy, drawing more moans from me. I gripped at the edge of his desk, unable to hold still. The sensation was too much. Too good. His tongue moved over me, tasting and exploring. Then he shifted, his fingers sliding out of my cunt. The wolf-man took hold of my legs and spread them wide apart. My feet were trapped between us, my ankles dangling over the edge of his desk. I moaned again as his tongue slid against my clit, rubbing softly.
>
>"Tell me, my dear," he said as he continued to tease my clit with his tongue. "Have you ever had your pussy eaten before?"
>
>"No," I said.
>
>"Is that because you don't know how it's done or is it simply a matter that you haven't found someone to do it?"
>
>"It's just not something that men have done to me." I looked at him over my shoulder. His eyes gleamed with hunger and lust. "But now... I am yours. You may do whatever you please to me."
>
>The wolf-man lifted his head and looked into my eyes. "Then you may be sure that I will make you come many times tonight. For I will enjoy tasting every inch of your body, sweet girl."
>
>He returned to my pussy, licking and sucking. I could feel his saliva dripping down my thighs as he worked me with his mouth. His fingers stroked into me and out. The way he touched me caused my breath to quicken. I could barely contain the pleasure building inside me.
>
>"I need you," I gasped. "I need your cock. Give it to me. Please."
>
>The wolf-man slid off the desk, his hands closing around my hips as he turned me. He pressed me back against it, his fingers sliding beneath my dress to grasp my ass cheeks. My back arched as he bent me over the desk, his cock pressing against my wet pussy. I could smell my own sex and it filled my nostrils. The wolf-man pressed his cock against me and slid inside me. I cried out at the feeling of being filled by such a huge cock. My ass pressed against the edge of the desk.

*Greetings, gentlemen—and behold! Forever ago in internet years I promised you a template update was coming along for Euterpe, and at long last it's finally here! This one's got it all: new context settings, new gen settings, new biases, and of course, a brand-new module. This cocktail of cutting-edge coomer technology hits like a truck, and thanks to a couple dedicated testers I have witnesses to corroborate that claim. So don't wait! Don't delay!

*As stated, this module is an experiment, one with results I didn't necessarily try to foresee. I think the more experimental/difficult lit I've thrown in leads to some incoherent generations on weirder settings, but it sure can get colorful. As I suppose you would with a lot of modules, try to use presets that allow more creativity. Be warned that some of the sources I've used contain vulgar material and sometimes focus on dark subject matters. If that kind of stuff bothers you, you might want to download some other modules instead.*

>Maître d'hôtel Jacques Bouvier's apartment is reached through a tall, fluted stone arched door on a tree-lined avenue in Paris. Passing the threshold, a sudden change of temperature and quality of light surprises and delights—it is warm inside, it is dark and dappled as if under a canopy of leaves, and it is full of bird sounds: coo and chir, trill and rattle. The noise of life.
>
>MY NEW OXYCODONE WAS delivered by a woman in a Ford, her hands trembling. Her driver's license said PALE CHASTITY. She wore a beaded purse over a slumming pink T-shirt that advertised TOKAY FARMERS MARKET: STEAK. EGGS. BLUEBERRIES AND PEAS, which I was inclined to like a great deal on any grounds.

>**"You fuckah!"** yelled Maza as he smashed in the young soldier's face with a mace.
>
>Maza stood above his prisoner, arm muscles rippling, spit frothing, chest heaving, dripping black saliva-tinged blood. There was an almost demonic aspect to the mace, as if it had crawled from the shadows of the Abyss, to take up, once more, its ancient form of execution in the Third Age of Man.
>
>Bugg and Chub stood open-mouthed, watching their boss. Maza was exulting. He'd spent weeks hunting through the army base for this one. The jig was up — the American's army was collapsing.

>**"What da hell are ya doin'?"** asked Mrs. Parmentier, as I emptied the remains of an impromptu urinal into her bathtub. 
>
>"Taking a bath."

>"I don't know about this," she said suspiciously, picking up a lumpy soap package, looking it over and squirting half of it on the surface of the water, while I stood near the sink dripping.

>"Well, now that we're here, you should probably fill me in." The King looked around at the empty streets, still full of trash but otherwise unremarkable. "Where is everybody?"
>
>"As far as I know," the Man in Black answered, "there's no one left in town. There was a fight between the Vampires and the Witches, apparently. Neither side has been able to hold on since then." He looked up at the sky again. It had begun to get dark and the clouds were rolling back in, revealing that night was approaching faster than it should be.
>
>"Why would anyone do this?"
>
>The Man in Black shrugged. "Who knows? We've got some sort of… messiah trying to clean up whatever he sees as problems in the world today. We're not sure if he's the good guy or the bad guy, but we don't have any reason to think he's going to stop until every Witch and Vampire on the planet is dead." He shrugged. "I'm really not a fan of this whole mess."
>
>"Messiah?" the King repeated slowly. The words didn't sit well with him. "What makes you say that?"
>
>The man frowned. "It's just… weird how much like… an angel he looks. I mean, they're all over the place these days. But this one… Well, it's not even a person. He's just some kind of… cloud… or something. It's crazy, but there are times when he makes people feel things… It's almost like he can make people believe in him. So maybe that's what it is. Maybe this whole mess is just the result of this one guy who is actually messing with everybody's head."
>
>"And then?" the King asked, gesturing around them at the deserted cityscape.
>
>"Well… he seems to think that by killing everyone, the problem will be solved. You know. Like the old… 'Death is the only solution' thing." The Man in Black shrugged. "Maybe he's right, but it seems a little drastic to me. You know, he says all this stuff about how he's trying to help us… but we haven't seen anything to show that he's doing us any favors. Nothing at all."

*The module is trained on fan-fiction stories focusing mostly on the beastfolk: Khajiit and Argonians. Many of the texts are NSFW; both M/F and M/M, without extreme fetishes. This module might come handy even if the adventures of your furry or scaly Tamriel travelers are not so lewd. But if you want your TES stories to be more general-themed or more SFW, try some other TES modules, for example The Elder Scrolls In-Game Texts.*

***What's new:** I decided to revise the TES Fiction module and reorganized the dataset. Now it's completely devoted to the specific topic and doesn't include any texts from the In-Game Texts dataset (except for The Lusty Argonian Maid and The Real Barenziah ;)).*

***Sources:** 115 fan-fiction short stories taken mostly from FurAffinity and SoFurry.*

***Tags:** fantasy, furry, Khajiit, Argonians, beastfolk, NSFW, M/F, M/M, TES, The Elder Scrolls, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim.*

>**I'm a Khajiit. So what? It means that I have** fur, and ears, and tail, and... well, and a little bit more, but you're not interested in that right now, are you? And you don't need to know my name either. All you need to know is that I'm a Khajiit who's looking for someone to spend the rest of his life with. Someone willing to accept me as I am, and not try to change me into something else. I've been running from people like that all my life. People who want to make me into something better than myself.
>
>My people are famous for being thieves and assassins, but we're also known for our love of music, art, poetry, and general mischief. Some say that it's all just a front--that our true nature is a dark one. But no matter how much I may enjoy teasing people or causing trouble when I can get away with it, deep down inside, I am still a good person at heart. I would never hurt anyone just for the sake of hurting them--unless they deserved it, of course.
>
>If you think that you might be the one I'm looking for, then please send me an email telling me about yourself. If you feel that you might fit the bill, then I'll give you my address so you can come visit me.

>**"Pull out, you dirty lizard!"** I said looking over at the red-scaled warrior.
>
>He shrugged and pulled out of me with a wet smack. He moved up to my head and kissed me hard, his tongue sliding into my mouth and forcing itself against mine. His hands were all over my body, caressing every part he could reach. He then dropped down beside me and rolled on top of me, straddling one leg atop each of mine as he sat up straight above me. "I'm going to fuck your ass now," he announced, staring down at me with lust in his eyes.
>
>"Oh, right..." I said, glancing back at him. "But... it's okay if I play with yours?"
>
>The Argonian laughed and shaked his head. "Not a chance."

>**"I just always wanted to know, kitty. Why do Khajiit lick their butts?" the Argonian grins,** a look of pure mischief in his eyes and an amused expression on his face. "Just curious."
>
>J'Zarr's tail whips back and forth behind him as he looks up at the Argonian with a very confused expression. He furrows his brows, trying to figure out why this strange lizard is asking such a bizarre question.
>
>"Because it feels good," J'Zarr says finally, answering the question with more than enough confidence for someone who has never been asked this by anyone before. The Argonian lets out a raspy laugh and shakes his head.
>
>"No, I'm just kidding ya, kitty," he smirks. "It tickles me when you try to act all serious about something so silly. You're cute like that!"

>**Lifts-Her-Tail: Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers.**
>
>**Crantius Colto:** Ahh... very well then, keep your paws off my things, lass.
>
>ifts-Her-Tail: No, you misunderstand, milord. It is a pleasure to serve such a fine man as yourself. If it is within the limits of my duties and abilities, I will do whatever you wish me to.
>
>Crantius Colto: Yes, that's what I like to hear, girl. Thank ye for yer service.
>
>Lifts-Her-Tail: My pleasure!
>
>Crantius Colto: Now, if you'll excuse me, there are some books I need to read before bed.
>
>Lifts-Her-Tail: Of course, milord, please take care in your reading.

>**"Listen, you southerner!"** It was the first time she'd heard him call her that since they had started to talk again. The way he said it made her feel like she'd just been slapped across the face. She turned, looking at him in surprise. He didn't look so well, his fur wasn't quite as well groomed as usual, and his shirt was rumpled.
>
>She walked up to him and leaned against the side of the wagon, crossing her arms over her chest. "I'm listening."
>
>He sighed, stepping forward and reaching out, grabbing her shoulder and turning her around to face him. "You're going back down south with your tail between your legs. That's what you're doing."
>
>She met his gaze evenly, refusing to let the anger she felt show on her face.

>The male looks away shyly as the female places her hands on his shoulders. He smiles, and the female too, but it isn’t nearly enough to cover up his obvious discomfort. They have never been close friends, not even acquaintances, just two sergals sharing a moment in a small tent with little else to do except stare at each other.
>
>It was inevitable, they both knew that. It wasn’t long before their unit was sent out into the wilds of the mountains.
>
>
>"I know I shouldn't," he says softly. "But..."
>
>She lays down beside him, resting her head on his chest. Her warm breath caresses his skin, and he feels a bit more comfortable with that alone than when she started talking.
>
>"I've been thinking about it all day," she murmurs. "About what we could be."
>
>He takes her muzzle between his hands, looking into those eyes he knows so well.
>
>"Don’t," he tells her. "You don’t want me."
>
>"No, I do. But..."
>
>"I am a soldier," he reminds her. "A soldier has no time for such things."
>
>She shakes her head, her expression one of defeat.

>**\*\*\***
>
>"So I don't have to kill you?" the sergal asked me, his voice smooth and cool as he reached for my throat. His claws were sharp. They would be very deadly in their own right.
>
>I had been expecting that question. "No," I replied. "I'll just be leaving." The sergal relaxed some more. He was still holding me in place with his claws, but he'd relaxed some of the pressure.
>
>The sergal's eyes met mine again, and this time they glinted with curiosity.
>
>He let out a low laugh and said, "You know, you're really cute." He slid his hands down my sides to hold on to my hips, then pressed forward so I could feel him pressing against my ass. "I think you can stay a little longer." he said.

Her mind had been taken over. She knew that, but it didn’t matter. She could feel a sense of euphoria and satisfaction in her head.
>
>She looked up at the man who had placed the device around her head. She could see the same look of satisfaction and approval in his eyes. He was pleased with what he had done to her. He had manipulated her mind, her body, and now her will. The device had taken her. She didn’t know how or why, but she was glad for it. She would serve him willingly. Anything he asked of her, she would do without hesitation. Her whole world had been turned upside down by this device. She loved it and wanted more.

>**Each thrum of the visor** made it hard to breathe. It felt like a giant hand was squeezing my throat and lungs with each beat, slowly strangling them as it pumped me full of more and more fluid. I couldn't tell if it was coming from the suit itself or some sort of power source on board, but there wasn't much time to worry about that at this point. The suit was growing around me faster than I could even process what was happening. Soon I was completely encased in latex, unable to move any part of my body.
>
>I was still conscious, however; the rubber didn't seem to have affected that. Instead it was like being inside a small metal box. I tried to open my mouth to speak, but no words came out. I tried opening my eyes, but they were sealed shut by the rubber over them. My hands had been trapped behind my back before the helmet closed, so I couldn't do anything with them either. In fact, I couldn't see a thing. All I could feel was the throbbing of my heart through my rubber suit. It seemed to be going a hundred miles an hour inside my chest, making my head spin.
>
>The suit felt heavy, too, but not in the way you'd expect it to. A lot heavier, actually. After all, it was only a single layer of latex. But I couldn't really tell without looking down, which I couldn't do because of the helmet on my head. And why would I want to look down? I wouldn't be able to see anything anyway.
>
>I heard footsteps. I turned my head slightly, trying to get a better look at whoever was approaching. All I saw was the red tinted visor that blocked my view. I felt along the sides of the helmet for a moment, trying to find the control panel.
>
>But there wasn't one. There was no way to turn it off. Not that I needed to. Whoever had put me into this suit controlled everything, including how long I would remain here. If they wanted to let me go, they could easily unlock the door and let me out of the helmet, right?

>**RX-4556**. A drone.
>
>The words echoed in his head, repeating over and over again. His mind felt like it was on fire as he tried to block out the pain of the shock collar around his neck. He didn't know what had happened, but he couldn't believe that something so horrible could have actually been done to him. He hadn't even seen who did this, or how it was possible for someone to change into a rubber version of themselves. It was more than just shocking though; it was terrifying.
>
>He heard footsteps approaching from behind him and immediately began turning to face them with his arms raised high above his head. The man walked up next to him and made eye contact before smiling at him in an almost fatherly way. "I am going to ask you one question, and I want you to answer me truthfully," said the man. RX-4556 nodded nervously and waited for whatever he wanted to hear.
>
>"Are you loyal to me?" asked the man in a commanding tone. There was no other option; RX-4556's mind knew that if he lied then there would be severe consequences.
>
>"Yes, sir!" answered RX-4556 enthusiastically.
>
>"Good boy." As soon as the words left his mouth he felt a sharp pain across his back, making him cry out. He winced as the shock collar shocked him again, causing him to flinch away from the man.

*This is a general furry module not focusing on particular species, topics or setting. The module is trained on hand-picked furry short stories. Most of them are NSFW; both M/F and M/M, without any extreme fetishes (apart from several BDSM stories). A fair amount of dragon/gryphon material is included too.*

***What's new:** Some texts from the previous version have been removed, and around 150 new texts have been added to the dataset. The module name is changed to a clearer one (the previous version for Sigurd was called Furry Module 1: Short Stories).*

***Sources:** 242 well-written furry short stories taken from FurAffinity, SoFurry and several other sources.*

***Tags:** furry, anthro, dragons, gryphons, NSFW, M/F, M/M.*

***Special notes:** 10.3 Mb, 3600 steps, 30.02% coverage, Loss: 2.761.*

>**Our tails** intertwined as we pressed our bodies together. I licked at his muzzle and felt a small growl come from him in response to it. His tongue reached out and ran over my snout, making me shiver with pleasure. He moved so he was on top of me, and pushed his cock along the length of my slit. It rubbed back and forth, teasing me by not entering me. I bucked my hips towards him, trying to get that thing inside me as soon as possible. But he held me down, keeping me pinned under his weight until he was ready to take me. That frustrated me, but only for a moment before I realized how good it felt to have him on top of me like this. The feeling of his tail wrapped around mine made me feel secure, even if I could still move freely underneath him. When he finally entered me, it was an intense sensation that made my eyes roll into the back of my head. I wanted to scream but instead bit down on his neck and let out a low moan of pleasure.

>**\*\*\***
>
>The mongoose was standing by a stream, staring into the water. He was naked, but he didn't mind. He enjoyed being naked; there was nothing wrong with it. The river lapped gently at the rocks behind him, and the sound of its flow made his heart lighten. The water carried away all his worries... until another sound drifted to his ears. Someone was coming towards him, splashing through the shallows at the stream's edge. It was a wolf, one he'd only met once before: a handsome specimen with a bright scar across his muzzle. He sat down next to the mongoose on the bank, and they stared out at the water together in silence.
>
>"You're alone here?" the wolf asked after some time had passed.
>
>"I'm not much company," the mongoose replied.
>
>"It doesn't matter," said the wolf, stroking his own fur. He glanced over at the mongoose, and smiled. "You look like you could do with some company." He got up and came close, then slid his hand down between the mongoose's legs. There was no resistance, just a soft sighing from the mongoose as he felt the wolf's warm fingers upon his prick.

>**"I had no idea a gryphon could** be so..." the dragoness began, trailing off as she trailed his eyes down to the floor. "So big." She took a deep breath and tried again. "You're an absolute beast, Lord Einar."
>
>Einar was stunned. He'd always thought himself fairly well-endowed in all things sexual, but he never dreamed that his size would have any effect on others... especially a female such as this.
>
>He stepped closer then and leaned into her, pressing his body against hers as he reached up and pulled her head to him for a gentle kiss. When he finally broke it off with a smile, the dragoness let out an involuntary moan.
>
>"As for being a beast? I'm afraid you're right." He gave her a wink, which caused a soft smile to spread across her face. "But if you'll let me, I can show you how good a beast I really am."

>**"You know what they say about felines:** the bigger the tail, the better the fuck," said Dario with a broad grin. "And your tail is so big."
>
>The lion was sitting in front of the fire, staring at the flames dancing across its surface and occasionally licking his muzzle as he thought hard about something that had just happened to him. At Dario's words, however, he gave a little start and looked up from the flickering embers of the fire. The raptor had been looking down the hall towards his room but now turned to face the lion. He smiled and held out one hand, waving it slowly around in the air.
>
>"I'm sorry," said Dario softly, "but I couldn't help myself. You can blame me if you want."
>
>The lion stared at him for a moment, then laughed and shook his head.
>
>"No, no, it wasn't your fault," he said. "It's just... I mean..." He trailed off as he struggled for the right words. "When did you get so bold?"
>
>Dario grinned sheepishly and shrugged again. He knew what the lion meant by that comment, and could see how embarrassed he was.

*Seems to pick up on the bondage influence in the training data more so than Sigurd did, so expect that.*

*Aight, done. It's updated on a cleaned version of the Harem.txt with all the double spacing removed and ⁂ added between stories as instructed by the manwhore guide. The link should work for 12 hours, and hopefully catbox is back to working after that so there can be a permanent link. I did some testing, and there doesn't appear to be a huge difference between this one and the first one, it still almost exclusively names girls from the story (though there was a little less of it) and otherwise writes out group sex scenes, with girls rotating, working together, or scuffling for space around the dick.*

*A first (and not necessarily good) attempt at training a module. Did it need to be trained with this amount of steps? Probably not, But I did it anyway. And since it exists now, so I might as well share it. The module has been trained on a selection of Literotica content, mostly from the Nonconsent & Reluctance and Exhibitionist & Voyeur categories, with an effort made to clean everything up manually.*

>Saori, you see, was always afraid of the dark. Her grandmother had taught her to fear it as long as she could remember; and all these years Saori's terror had only increased in strength like a poison-dart buried deep within her brain. It hurt more than pain: it made itself felt far down into the very marrow of Saori's bones—and through this blackness that oppressed her there were often flashes from the other world. From some source she did not understand they came to pierce Saori with sudden electric shocks. The soundless whispers that followed them would chill any girl who heard them: but even worse things still awaited Saori when the night was at its deepest and darkest, and nothing moved except for bats or shadows cast by moonlight. Then suddenly she might become aware of something moving near her bedside—a faint shadow creeping slowly up over the coverlet toward her body. In the darkness such sensations are hard to fight off...

>She lifted her face from the vid and looked at me, expressionless.

>I frowned. 'How do you mean?'

>'The Hand of God is a device, built by the government of Sanction to defeat the Syndicate. It uses quantum computing technology to create a self-regenerating hypervirus that kills every brain in the human genome. This happens to be a fairly useful thing for anyone with a personal grudge against their neighbours.'

>'I don't know,' she said. 'But that's what I'd do if I was planning to kill everyone on the planet.' She paused for a moment, eyes fixed on her reflection in the water. 'I used to wonder why the Hand of God was so hard to track down. I mean, it's only one of a kind. Why not just hide it somewhere safe until they needed it again?'

>**I screamed as the scintillating light poured forth from my outstretched hand**, and I fell to one knee. My eyes burned with it. The pain was blinding, but that wasn't what made me scream. It was a feeling of utter helplessness—the same kind you get when someone has taken control of your body without asking permission or telling you how they're going to use it. You know that something is happening, but there's nothing you can do about it. And all too often in life, people who take such liberties are doing so for their own amusement rather than yours.
>
>The power flowed through me like an ocean current, overwhelming everything else inside my head except for the simple need to survive. Every muscle spasmed in unison, and I felt myself convulse as if I'd been hit by a train. There were only two things left inside my mind: the desperate need to keep breathing and the urge to throw up. They both battled each other desperately, until finally one won out over the other. I gasped in air while simultaneously trying not to hurl on the pavement at my feet. Then the spell was done, and I slumped back against the wall, panting hard.
>
>My vision cleared slowly, as did my hearing. When it came clear enough that I could see where I was standing again, I saw Murphy sitting beside me. She had her knees drawn up and was hugging them tightly around herself, rocking gently. Her face was white with fear. "Oh," she said softly.

>**The setting sun sent fingers of golden light** into the deep woods, making them sparkle and glow. A gentle breeze blew from the north to caress the trees as they swayed in a dance with each other's leaves. The air was sweetly scented by flowers that had bloomed only yesterday—the scent of violets mingled with the perfume of wild roses. It was a warm day for midwinter; the last rays of sunlight were brightening the treetops when Skipper saw a figure standing motionless on top of the highest hill. He squinted his eyes against the glare as he watched her gaze out over the forest, watching him watch her.

>"She looks like she's waiting for someone," said Cattail. "Or maybe it's just me."

>Skipper shrugged and smiled at the squirrelmaid. "You're right, Cattie, but who would be coming up here today?"

*OBJECTION! Trained on transcripts from Ace Attorney, visual novel series known for courtroom drama and detective work.*
***Tags:** visual novel, transcript, courtroom*

***Sources:** Original trilogy, Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, Spirit of Justice, Ace Attorney Investigations 1-2. 6160 steps at 100%, 2.35loss.*

***Notes:***
- *Bias for OBJECTION! and HOLD IT! for extra entertainment.*
- *Testimony, cross-examination and such are denoted by parentheses in the training data, e.g.( Cross examination: What Really Happened )*
- *The original dataset contains too many lines with ellipses only, which caused the previous (Sigurd) module to get stuck in loops. Dropped 70% of the ellipses-only lines to reduce the chances of this happening.*

>Blackquill: So? What does it show you? You've watched it a thousand times over already, haven't you?!
>
>Phoenix: This is my chance! If I can just prove that this was all part of Mr. Justice Minister's plan...
>
>Maya: Ohhh! That would be a lot harder than just saying it out loud!
>
>Phoenix: ...All right then, let me try something different. It might work better with this case.
>
>Athena: Hey now! Let's hear his idea first, before you start getting impatient and yelling "No fair" at him!
>
>Apollo: I'm ready! (Let me see! )
>
>Maya: Yeah! Let him explain things as he sees them! That should clear up any misunderstandings in the courtroom!
>
>Phoenix: Very well. I will attempt to convince you all by showing you exactly what happened on that fateful day.

>**I grabbed my sword's hilt** and started running toward the source of the voice. I came out from behind a small boulder, my feet moving faster than usual, almost as if they knew where to step before I did.
>
>A young boy was on his knees, his hands in the air with a smile on his face. His body had been pierced through by a thick piece of wood that had been driven into the ground like a stake. A man in his late thirties was standing over him holding a bloody dagger.
>
>"No need for that," The old man said calmly. "We both know that you are going to come down here eventually."
>
>I drew my sword from its scabbard, not taking my eyes off the man. His stance wasn't overly aggressive, but then again he had just attacked the boy without warning. I was confident in my sword skills, so all I had to do was land my first strike and end this quickly. That being said though, I still didn't want to take any chances.
>
>The man smirked. "You're brave." He walked forward, still keeping his distance from me.
>
>I took a few steps back, putting more space between us. This wasn't working.
>
>"You know there is no point to continuing this. You have nothing." He raised his hand and pulled it back, revealing a blade of light that was now burning brightly. In my mind I could already see the scene playing out. The man would kill the boy and I would have no choice but to watch him go down.
>
>And then there was the issue of me being unarmed. The man had a dagger and an arcane blade; two types of weapons that were considered lethal by most standards. My only option was to end the fight right now.
>
>As the man brought the blade down, I let out a shout and dove to the side, my sword coming down at a diagonal angle.
>
>The man was quick, but not quite quick enough. I was able to deflect the attack with my sword. It was enough of a force that it sent his sword flying from his hands, but the man was unharmed, although his left arm was bleeding quite heavily. The arcane blade flew past me harmlessly, and then I took advantage of the momentary lapse in his guard. I thrust my sword upward, piercing into his chest with one fluid motion.

>**Recipe: Chocolate Salvation**
>
>MAKES 1 SERVING
>
>This is an adaptation of a traditional chocolate pudding that my mom used to make. She would serve it with some whipped cream on top, but I prefer it as just a rich, decadent pudding all by itself. The addition of the coconut oil and the cacao powder make this version really special. If you don't have any coconut or cacao powder, no worries—this recipe will still taste amazing without them!
>
> 6 tablespoons (100 g) unsalted butter
>
> 1 large egg
>
> 3-4 heaping tablespoons cacao powder (optional)
>
> ¼ teaspoon sea salt
>
> 2 tablespoons sugar
>
> 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
>
> 1/8 cup heavy cream (or coconut milk for dairy free)
>
>INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside to use later. In a medium saucepan combine the butter, cocoa, and water. Whisk continuously over low heat until it begins to thicken into a sauce-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining sugar (about ¼ cup) and whisk constantly for another 3 minutes while bringing the temperature up to 240°F (115°C). At this point you want to remove from the heat but keep whisking, as it will continue to cook at this temperature, becoming thicker. When the temperature reaches 240°F add in the salt, the remaining sugar, and the egg and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Place in fridge until cold. Once cooled whip the cream and spread atop your chilled pudding.

***Data:** 262kb, 517 steps, 172.79%.*

*I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan. I originally made this module for Sigurd, but now I've ported it to Euterpe. Let's see what Euterpe will do if we feed her MJ lyrics! I compiled Michael Jackson's lyrics from his studio album solo discography into training data.*

***Source Material:***
*All of the songs from his solo studio album discography. The only stuff I didn't include is the demos from The Ultimate Collection in 2004, and most of the posthumous tracks from the Michael and Xscape albums. I omitted them mostly for philosophical reasons/out of respect, because Michael didn't like people hearing unfinished or unreleased stuff he did. The only exceptions to that were Hold My Hand and A Place With No Name which were basically finished and getting ready for release shortly before he died. I also included Xscape because I believe that had been intended for release at some point before it got leaked and he cancelled.*

***Headings? What?***

*Headings are stuff in the lyrics like Intro, Verse 1, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Outro. That is not a definitive list of headings, but it's generally that sort of thing. Additionally I tagged every song like:*

    [Title: ; Artist: ; Genre: ; Tags: ]

*There were tags like duet, young MJ, adult MJ, happy, sad, angry, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, social commentary, privacy, stalker, diss track, etc depending on the song.*

***What do I do with this module?***

*I dunno. Throw in some tags, then an "Intro", "Verse", or whatever headings if you like. I just made this for experimentation, and to use up some steps before they run out. Fuck around with the modules and do what you like.*
