### [Traditional](#writers)

#### [Clark Ashton Smith](https://files.catbox.moe/ezoai8.module)

[by ☄WanderingStar](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/941647194845483018)

*Pure, 100%, unadulterated Clark Ashton Smith. Prose only, no poetry, mostly very short-form fiction. Expect exotic locales and fanciful character names. Somewhat archaic diction and a more verbose style with longer sentences. A tendency to develop narrative rather quickly after initial set-up due to prevalence of short-form fiction. Darker themes generally but also capable of a light touch with the right prompt.*

***Tags:** Fantasy, cosmic horror, gothic, short stories, single-author, style-oriented.*

***Sources:** Volumes 1-5 of his collected stories (excluding the juvenalia, vol. 6). 80% coverage, 3.01 loss (perhaps the exotic names are to be blamed for this, but it is still quite coherent).*

>The night was very black, and the stars were hidden by a pall of smoke that hung over the city like a cloud. The air was full of ashes; and in the streets there was no sound but the rattle of wheels on the pavement, and the low murmur of voices from the open windows of the houses. It seemed to me that I had never seen such an empty-looking place before, nor heard so many doors shut at once; and I thought it strange that all should be quiet when the whole world was in tumult. But then I remembered that this was not a time for people to go abroad except in disguise or under cover of darkness. And as we came nearer the palace, I saw that the gates were closed, and the guards posted within their portals. They looked at us with fixed eyes through the gloom, and did not move until we had passed them.
>
>We went up the broad steps of the great portico, which was lit by torches placed upon brackets along its sides. We entered the building without being challenged; and after passing through several large rooms, we found ourselves in a smaller hall whose walls were hung with tapestries of gold and silver, and whose floor was paved with marble slabs. There was no one about, save a few slaves who carried lamps into other parts of the house.
>
>At last we reached a door of carved wood, and knocked softly upon it. A voice answered us from within: "Who comes?"
>
>"It is the Prince," said my father.
>
>A moment later a man opened the door, and admitted us. He was tall and thin, and wore a robe of purple velvet embroidered with golden threads.

>The necromancer's face was a mask of horror. He had been expecting something like this, but not quite so soon; and he felt that his own powers were failing him in the presence of such an evil influence as this. His voice trembled with fear when he spoke to the corpse-man: "What is your will? What do you desire?"
>
>"I want to be taken back," said the dead man, "to my place of rest."
>
>"You shall have it!" cried the necromancer, seizing the body by the arms and dragging it from the bed. The thing seemed to weigh no more than a child; and its limbs moved stiffly under his hands as if they were made of wood or stone.
>
>"Where are we going?" asked the dead man, as he followed after his master into the corridor.
>
>"To the tomb chamber," answered the necromancer.
>
>They went down many winding stairs, and through dark passages which led them farther and farther away from the house of the sorcerer. At length they came to a huge vaulted room whose walls were covered with frescoes of death and desolation. The floor was strewn with bones and skulls, and here and there lay the corpses of men and women who had died long ago. In the center of the chamber stood a sarcophagus, and on top of it rested a skeleton clad in black armor and carrying a sword and shield. This figure was the necromancer himself.

#### [C. S. Lewis](https://mega.nz/file/VGwygKKa#oUAumhzb2td1uEyv_qDlC1XLnz0Ali66O4_dSqvEzN0)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371550395)

*I've trained my CS Lewis module for Euterpe V2. Tested and seems to be working extremely well, his style comes through much more strongly than it did with Sigurd.*

*Training data is most of Lewis's fiction: Narnia books, Space Trilogy, Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, Til We Have Faces, Pilgim's Regress. Plus a small selection of non-fiction works: Mere Christianity, The Four Loves, The Weight of Glory.*

#### [E. E. Cummings](https://files.catbox.moe/lmyt7f.module)

[by mark and jez](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/949684086685962270)

*An experiment trained on the works of E.E. Cummings (or e e cummings) to see how Euterpe would handle more unorthodox/uncommon styles of poetry.*

***Tags:** poetry, experimental, modernism*

***Sources:** Poems by e e cummings (71 kb, 79 steps, 543.28% coverage, Average Loss: 3.6422)*

***Notes:** I purposefully left in whitespaces that include stanza breaks and the unconventional spacing that Cummings liked to make use of. Because of this, Euterpe will sometimes generate a sea of ` ` that might make things tricky sometimes but regenerations and adjustments to your presets will fix things. Keep your rep pen low if you don't want Euterpe to start writing prose. I'd recommend using presets with higher temperatures.*

#### [George Orwell](https://files.catbox.moe/twyx0p.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371627864)

*Someone suggested to do this as a module. Done.*

*ZIP file contains the module, the training data, the image, and the base for the training data I formatted. So if at some point [Euterpe V3] or [20] beaks or whatever the fuck comes out and I'm not there to retrain the modules, you'll have everything you need.*

#### [Hunter S. Thompson](https://files.catbox.moe/cr8tuh.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/376546016/#376651450)

*Alright, results look good enough to me, so here's my Hunter S. Thompson module for Euterpe.*

*Since whoever made the Sigurd one didn't leave training data, I started from scratch and ended up with the following books in the training data: Hell's Angels, Fear and Loathing: Las Vegas, Fear and Loathing: Campaign Trail, Great Shark Hunt, Curse of Lono, Generation of Swine, Songs of the Doomed, Better Than Sex, Proud Highway Saga, Rum Diary, Fear and Loathing: America, Screwjack, Kingdom of Fear, Hey Rube, and Fear and Loathing: Rolling Stone.*

*Due to the prevalence of Thompson's own name in the writing, banning "Hunter" and "Thompson" is recommended if you don't want the AI to immediately go for those if it needs a name.*

*Finally, here's the full pack for this module: <https://files.catbox.moe/szni1m.zip>*

*Usually, I only share my modules with the full pack, but since this pack is 50 MB in size, I linked only the module file as well. Anyway, this contains everything I used in training: The source ebooks, the plaintext conversion, and the edited training data I used.*

*So if Krake gets modules and I'm dead and unable to retrain, some other step slut can just retrain this.*

*Have fun!*

>Here was the city that I loved. Nothing could be clearer and more impressive than its ancient majesty, with high ramparts towering in every direction over paved stone roads bordered by fine wrought iron streetlamps... it took my breath away! I went toward a restaurant called The Black Diamond in Plaza del Mascaras at two o'clock sharp. When I entered, the air smelled of garlic and oil; tables were set out on an enormous marble floor under vaulted ceilings decorated with frescoes showing scenes from Roman history and classical mythologies—a huge dining room indeed! Some people passed through: well dressed ladies wearing little black hats whose creases told their owners how many times they had been removed. There sat at one table Clara Cardellini eating spinach soup and crumb cake while her husband Giannis licked butter off his knife's tip. Next to them old Jocasta Doria drank straight-from-the-jug wine as she ate meatballs followed by red pears sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. On another side of the big square, sitting at a large round table surrounded by half-dressed waiters, was the great industrialist Eusebio Astrada y Gómez drinking something made out of potatoes he'd just bought at a nearby market stall for six pesetas apiece. And then there stood Antonio Marcelino, who owned the largest shipyard on the Spanish Main. His friend Carlos Paredes sipped champagne out of glasses shaped like cherries that seemed almost too small to contain such a powerful beverage.

***Tags:** LOTR, Hobbit, Fantasy, Tolkien*

*Sources: The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit books

*This is a retrain of an existing module that was considerably cleaned up, trained to one epoch. There are some odd formatting issues with quotes but the issues are considerably less than the old module.*

*An update to the Sigurd Lafferty module.*

*There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma (he died in 2002), who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. - Niel Gaiman.*

*Lafferty's work influenced a lot of later science fiction writers even though nobody writes like him. I did a 30% module and didn't really like the output much, but this 60% module seems to be capable emulating his style a bit, particularly if you prime the pump with some of his text to start with (as in the example).  I expect this one to be a niche taste at best, but am releasing it for those who might care.*

*Trained to **60%** with **1900** steps.*

***Source Material:** Trained on 106 short stories; 400,000+ words.*

*Too many to list but includes Selenium Ghosts of the Eighteen-Seventies, Continued On the Next Rock, About a Secret Crocodile, Slow Tuesday Night, Nine Hundred Grandmothers, And Now Walk Gently Through the Fire, Groaning Hinges of the World, Among the Hairy Earthmen, The World As Will and Wallpaper, Narrow Valley, Ginny Wrapped In the Sun, The Skinny People of Leptophlebo Street, Land of the Great Horses, Thus We Frustrate Charlemagne*

*Chandler's detective stories and novels are genre fiction which often transcends itself due to his eye for character and his way of turning a phrase. This module is deliberately overtrained so as to make it copy his style as much as possible, so it is based on probably his most famous novel.*

*Trained to 100.49% with 391 steps.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371610961)

*Alright, I'm going to be retraining my modules for Euterpe over the course of the day. Here's the first one: The Rod Serling module.*

*Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the module, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

*What to say about Pynchon?  If dense and eclectic is your thing look no further. But don't expect much plot, character development, or even consistent tone. It's all very weird and surrealistic. The books in training here are full of strange characters and situations, many of which are modeled after real historical figures and events.*

*Trained to 30.18% with 1154 steps.*

***Source Material:** Trained on "Gravity's Rainbow" and "Mason&Dixon", two of my personal favorites.  You may need to bias against "Mason" because it really likes that name.*

*Books included are: Greenwich Killing Time, A Case of Lone Star, When The Cat's Away, Frequent Flyer, Musical Chairs, Elvis Jesus & Coca-Cola, Armadillos & Old Lace, God Bless John Wayne, The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover, Roadkill, Blast From The Past, Steppin On A Rainbow, Curse of the Missing Puppet Head, Ten Little New Yorkers, Spanking Watson, The Prisoner of Vandam Street, Kill Two Birds & Get Stoned, The Christmas Pig: A Fable, The Mile High Club*

>The next day I was in my office when McGovern came by. The windows were open and the air smelled like a New York City garbage dump, but it felt good to be back in the city after so long on the road. There were signs of spring all around me – birds chirping outside the window, flowers blooming in the yard, and even the cat had stopped hissing at me. As he walked in, McGovern said, "I've got some news for you."
>
>"Any good?" I asked hopefully.
>
>"There's been a murder," he replied with a grim look.
>
>My heart sank. It seemed that every time I'd thought we'd gotten out of trouble, something else would rear up and throw itself into the fray. My hopes for a quiet little life were not coming true. In fact, there didn't seem to be any way I could ever get out from under the constant burden of trying to find a missing person or a murderer.

[25% coverage version](https://files.catbox.moe/g1area.module)

*Trained on Antony Beevor's WW2 Histories at 50% and 25%. Works include Ardennes, Arnhem, Stalingrad, The Battle for Spain, The Fall of Berlin and The Second World War. I made two hoping that 25% would be better for different settings but both seem to lean heavy on WW2 anyway. The style is highly detailed so outputs are often going to include names of specific units, generals, location, weapons, vehicles etc.*

***Tags:** 3rd Person War History, WW2*

*Frocto: 7632 steps, 80% AVG Loss: 3.03*

*Frocto is a semi-similar case [to [TheGoHt](#thegoht)]. Albeit more femdommy. Large proportions, voluptous women. That sorta thing.*

*ManyEyedHydra: 3194 steps, 80.03% AVG Loss: 2.92*

*ManyEyedHydra mainly deals in monster girls. Primarily succubi though you get some other ones in there, such as fairies and slime. Tends to be more traditional in regards to succubi and monstergirls (i.e. they actually soul suck/kill people through sex).*

*Slutwriter: 7811 steps, 80% AVG Loss: 2.92*

*Barring those he deleted over the years and some stories I had to trim due to weird formatting/similar content, I crammed the training data with almost all of SlutWriter's works from HF and Ao3. Each piece was individually cleaned up with Notepad++.*

#### [Smutknight](https://files.catbox.moe/5nz58q.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/372108509/#372167471)

*Smutknight: 1237 steps, 100.04%, Couldn't check the loss on this one. It was made during the weird training hiccups that ate steps and I got booted from the Loss graph screen right after I downloaded the module.*

*Smutknight is somewhat vanilla smut, as far as my tastes go anyways, but results have been good for me so far. Author focused a lot on League of Legends and fantasy settings but the module should slot into most topics just fine.*

#### [Tastatura](https://files.catbox.moe/hc44bv.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371558509)

*Here is the Euterpe trained Tastatura module. This online smut writer features very verbose and raunchy subjects, often revolving around incest, maledom, a bit of loli, and a lot of big-dick shota. Trained to 70%/5~ MB of data. Use at your own risk.*

*TheGoHt: 1734 steps, 100.02% AVG Loss: 2.75*

*TheGoHt does large proportions. Descriptions of big tits and the like. I think he teetered on inflation porn for a bit? But I don't remember it cropping up too much in his writing.*

>**A glistening black carapace slithered sensuously through the shadows of a narrow corridor.** The creature's long, sinuous body moved with fluid grace and it was difficult to believe that such an elegant form could be so deadly. But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And what one man finds beautiful another might find hideous—and vice versa.
>
>The alien paused at the corner where two corridors intersected. It turned its head slightly toward the left-hand passage and made no move to go down that way. Instead, it continued along the right side, pausing now and then as if listening for something. When nothing came from this direction either, it went on into the darkness ahead. There were sounds coming from there, too: muffled voices, footsteps echoing off metal walls. The alien did not stop but crept forward slowly, carefully, like a cat hunting mice.
>
>At last the alien reached the end of the passageway. Here it stopped once more, crouching low against the wall and holding itself motionless. Then, without warning, it launched itself across the gap between the two corridors and landed softly behind three men who had been talking quietly together when they heard the sound. One of them whirled around just as the alien struck him in the back of his neck with one powerful claw. He dropped instantly to the floor, dead before he hit. Another man tried to turn away from the attack but found himself caught by the claws that tore out his throat. Blood gushed forth in a crimson flood. The third man screamed and fell to the ground, trying desperately to roll aside from the grasping arms that pinned him to the decking.

>**Standing in the mouth of that great entrance, the chill air of the tomb** blowing across my face like a cold wind from the desert night, I could not help thinking how strange it was to be so close to death. It seemed as if some spell had been laid upon me which would cause me at any moment to turn and run back into the darkness with all speed; yet no sooner did this thought enter my mind than there came an impulse within me compelling me on toward those mighty doors through whose dark portals lay eternal rest for Pharaohs, and their servants who loved them. My heart beat high against my breast until it felt as though it must burst its bonds, but still I went forward without faltering or turning aside. The silence grew more profound around us now, broken only by our own footsteps and the sound of Nefertiti's soft breathing behind me. As we neared the end of the long passage before us she stopped suddenly and turned about to look up at me. "Do you see?" she whispered. Her voice trembled slightly with excitement—and fear? "There is something here," she said again.

>**"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I** took an arrow in the knee,” is a common saying among most Khajiit. The phrase refers to the fact that, for all their agility and stealthy ways, they are ill-equipped physically to survive a protracted campaign against hostile creatures. As such, though many Khajiit may be found adventuring (even as far away as Skyrim), more often than not they find themselves engaged in some kind of trade or activity which involves less risk to life and limb.

>**When in Morrowind, do** as the Daedra do. When your character is a Daedric Prince, you know this to be true. The Daedric Princes are experts at how they live their lives — and how we should all live ours. After all, if it were not for Daedra, there would be no Daedric Princes! And where would they be without us?
>
>These few simple rules should help you get started on the path toward becoming the best version of yourself possible:
>
>1\. Be honest with your friends and your family. If someone asks you what you’re doing with your life, answer honestly: “I am a Daedric Prince who is exploring new lands and having fun.” Don’t lie about it like I did when my parents asked me why I was playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim so much.

>**"Hey Alduin,"** I said, “would you mind sharing your cave with me?”
>
>Alduin was still a little mad at me because of the time when I had taken his favorite cave and turned it into an inn. He was sitting in front of his cave looking sad and lonely. I could tell that he really needed some company right now and he looked like he would be glad to have mine. So I went over to him.
>
>“Howdy there, big fella!” I said. “I know we haven’t always gotten along but I don’t mean any harm by this...”
>
>He grunted at me but didn’t say anything. I took a deep breath and started talking again, hoping to calm him down, “Look, Alduin, you were just so beautiful and scary and awesome that I couldn’t resist showing off by trying to steal your cave from you. It was all my fault, really, so why don’t you let me stay here for awhile until I can come up with something better?”
>
>The dragon sighed deeply and slowly shook his head. But then he gave me a look that made me feel like maybe he wasn’t quite as angry anymore.
>
>“Fine,” he said, “but if you cause even one bit of trouble, I will eat you.”
>
>“That won’t be necessary,” I told him. “If you promise not to go on a rampage or destroy anything, I will leave everything exactly where it is. As long as you don’t eat anyone who comes through here, I think we can both be happy."

>**Here's a list of Sheogorath's best quotations:**
>
>**1\.** “I am the god of insanity and chaos, but I have not forsaken you. My madness is your salvation!”
>
>2\. “My minions are the stars in my sky... and I will take them all down into darkness with me.”
>
>3\. “The world has been mine since time began! The gods are dead. You mortals are nothing more than an annoying distraction to me as I await the coming of Oblivion.”
>
>4\. “Do not fear for the future. It is already written... and it is written in blood.”

***Note:** This is the same module as before, but trained with a 1280 token context.*

*Constructed from edited character descriptions and locations from Fallout: New Vegas, and leavened out with classic apocalyptic tales that were an influence on Fallout. Drawing upon Cold War era 1950's stories, and their perspectives of the apocalypse and the future, this theme module draws upon authors such as Pat Frank, George R. Stewart, and Phillip K. Dick, with a small dash of Fallout pre-war Fanfic.  The selection of fiction has been curated to these written in the style and tone of the 1950's, mostly by finding actual representative works. This also brings the tech level in line with the 1950's.*

*If you really want a pure Fallout experience, you'll need to construct a scenario with lorebook support. Material is attached for this:*

>**The sky lit up with a fire brighter than a thousand suns,** and the ground shook as if it was being torn apart by an earthquake. There were explosions that seemed to shake the whole world, and people screamed in terror. The air became thick with smoke so dense and choking that they could barely see each other's faces. A huge dome of flame rose into the blackness beyond the horizon. It consumed everything in its path without discrimination or mercy, leaving behind nothing but scorched earth and shattered buildings.
>
>It was no longer possible for anyone to hide from this monster; it had come directly out of hell itself. In the days following, there were more and more frequent reports of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tidal waves caused by some unknown force. That night, when the skies went dark and the earth trembled under their feet, many thought that the end of the world had finally arrived. But not everyone believed in such a terrible fate; some even laughed at those who did, saying that it was just another false alarm. They didn't know what they were talking about, because now they knew better than anyone else how real this nightmare actually was.
>
>One day, one month after the disaster, when all hope had been lost, a man appeared on the steps of the main church in the city center. He told everyone gathered there that he would be able to save them all. At first, people were skeptical, thinking him mad, but soon enough they began to believe that he really could do something. So they gave him money and food, which he used to buy medicine and weapons, and then set forth on his journey.
>
>He traveled far into the mountains, through forests and deserts where the sun was always hot and dry, over rivers swollen with spring rain, past villages that had never heard of him before, and finally came to a place where there were neither buildings nor people. Here, in a valley surrounded by high cliffs, the man found a hidden cave, cut deep into the rock face. He decided to stay here for awhile and rest until things quieted down.
>
>But even though he had reached a safe haven, the man still couldn't sleep. His mind was full of memories and doubts: He'd failed to protect his wife; he hadn't been able to keep the children alive; and now, all alone in this godforsaken land, he was afraid of dying too.

>**Leaving Neverwinter, the dwarf Magnus Bigpuffer reflected on his journey north, to Luskan.** In truth he had done nothing more than follow the trail of gold and gems. That was enough for him. He was a dwarf, after all, and dwarves did not often ask why they took this path or that; instead they simply followed their noses. But now that he was here, in Luskan, it was time to make some sense of things.

>**The stand user** was a young man with short black hair and dark skin. He wore a long-sleeved shirt that covered his entire body, with the exception of the hand he held up in front of him for us to see. This was the man who had killed my family and made me a slave.
>
>I was at my wits' end as I stood there watching this young man look down on me from above. The first thing that came into my mind was, "How did he find me?"
>
>That's not it though...
>
>"No..."
>
>My eyes met those of the man standing over me. It looked like they were filled with nothing but hatred, as if he were saying, "You're dead." I couldn't understand it, but it sure felt like he thought killing me was easy. That was enough to make my heart race. If this man didn't care about himself or about his own life, he could kill me without hesitation. And so I thought, "He can kill me anytime he wants." As long as he wanted to do it.
>
>This feeling, this certainty, was something I'd never known before. I didn't feel fear, but a sense of calm, as if I was being protected by a force greater than myself.
>
>"Who are you?" I asked.
>
>In response, the man said one word:
>
>"Dio."
>
>The name rang a bell, but I couldn't quite remember where I knew it from. When I heard the rest of the words that followed, however, my memory clicked into place. Dio? That was the name of a character from an anime I used to watch when I was little. He was a villain. A horrible, cruel, greedy, evil, sadistic villain. One of the most hated characters in a world full of villains.
>
>I remembered that. But what did he want with me? Why come all the way out here just to threaten me?

>*I looked through the window of* my office, taking in the sights. The crowd had thinned out considerably since I'd last checked on it, but there were still plenty of people on the streets. It's not like I could just close the curtains and pretend that those people didn't exist... No, if anything, I should be glad I have a job where I can help them while I'm at it.
>
>The Nest wasn't really all that big. My boss only had me look after one office, so all I needed to do was check up on it every few hours. That way, I figured I wouldn't get tired too easily.
>
>"Hm? Oh! There you are!"
>
>This time, the voice came from behind me. I turned around and saw my co-worker walking towards me with a smile on his face. He was pretty strong for someone who had such a small body, so he often picked up some of the more heavier items our customers brought in.
>
>"Hey, what brings you here today?"
>
>He gave me a pat on the shoulder before answering. "Just checking up on you." Then he pointed out into the distance. "You know how crowded it is outside right now, right?"
>
>I nodded as I took another glance at the street outside. Yeah, I knew. When I first started working in this Nest, it was much quieter than it was now. But I guess over time, word got around about the good work we did, and now the Nest was busier than ever. I couldn't complain, though. Our customers were always grateful when they left here, and we got to keep working without having to worry about being kicked out by our landlord.
>
>"Yeah, you're right," I said. "So what about it?"
>
>"Well, I heard that some guy came in earlier saying he wanted to hire us for an important job, something along those lines..."

>"I don't want to be a burden. I'm not asking you for anything."
>
>She was lying on the bed in her room, wearing nothing but an oversized T-shirt and shorts. A puddle of sweat had formed beneath her head. Her cheeks were flushed red from the heat—the same color as her hair.
>
>Her voice was so calm that it didn't seem like she was trying to convince him at all. She sounded like she knew what she wanted. Like she already had everything figured out and there was no more need to pretend. It made me feel uneasy just listening to her talk about money.
>
>But... I guess she's right. I'll pay whatever we need, if it means making her happy.
>
>I thought I was going to have to say something about how much money we needed, but before I could even open my mouth, she spoke up again:
>
>"Do you know why I joined this job?"
>
>I shook my head. "No."
>
>"It's because I couldn't take any more of what they did to me when I was younger. Because I never got any better after that. And now, it's come back around and bit me in the ass again."
>
>"What do you mean?"
>
>"The Syndicate is the only place that will hire me, so I can't get myself off their hook by doing something illegal or getting arrested."

>There was a sense of peace here, a feeling she hadn't felt since leaving the Pride Lands behind. But at the same time, it felt like it wasn't truly hers to claim or hold on to.
>
>She had been living outside of the Pride Lands for several months now, finding a place with other lions who had no desire to be part of the pride hierarchy. They were content to live their own lives without having any responsibilities to the others around them.

>**Like a shark through dark waters, the shadowy figure slipped through the night with predatory grace**. The streetlights and neon signs of downtown Baltimore blinked out behind it as it moved quickly down one side street after another. It had been more than two weeks since the last time it had fed—and even that meager meal had left its taste in its mouth like ashes on the tongue. There was no reason to think tonight would be any different; but still, there were times when hunger could not be denied. And so, for now, it continued moving along without pause or rest until it found what it sought.
>
>The streets grew emptier as the creature traveled deeper into the city's heart. Soon only a few scattered pedestrians wandered about their business by lamplight. One man hurried across the street at an intersection, oblivious to the fact that he might have been struck dead instantly if his path had crossed that of the predator stalking him from around the corner. A woman paused before a convenience store window, staring inside longingly while her purse hung casually over her shoulder. Another woman sat alone at a table outside a coffee shop, reading a book as she sipped from a cup of steaming liquid. Her eyes flicked up occasionally, but never once did they meet those of the creature watching her from the shadows. She paid little attention to anything except the words on the page in front of her.
>
>It waited patiently, almost leisurely, for several minutes longer. When the woman finally closed her book and stood, leaving her chair empty beside the table, the creature took action. It moved silently through the shadows toward her. As it drew closer, the woman looked up suddenly, startled by the sudden movement. She tried to turn away, but too late. In a flash, the creature leapt forward and grabbed her arm, yanking her to the ground. Before she knew what was happening, she was face-to-face with its fangs. The woman screamed and fought against the thing holding her, trying to get free. But it held fast, pressing her head back into the wet pavement beneath them both. Its grip tightened, and the woman cried out again. The creature leaned close, letting her feel the heat of its breath on her skin. "Don't struggle," it whispered in a voice like death itself.

>Billy glanced at Citan. "Are you sure about this?" he asked. Billy was right to be concerned. He could not tell whether Citan actually had the power to do such a thing, or if it was just an act.
>
>Citan nodded as he stood up and walked over to the door. "I'm sure," he said with a confident smile on his face. "You'll see."
>
>The door opened and Citan stepped out into the corridor. There were no guards around; they must have been inside their rooms. Citan took off down the hall towards the elevators.
>
>"Wait! You can't go alone!" Billy yelled after him, but he couldn't stop Citan from leaving. The elevator doors closed before he could even finish saying anything else. Billy turned to the others and sighed. "Looks like we're going in alone," he muttered under his breath.
>
>Fei looked at the other Gears. He could feel the tension running through them all. They all knew that Citan's plan might fail, or worse, it could result in Citan's death. "I don't think we should let Citan do this by himself. If anything happens to him..." His voice trailed off and he stared vacantly at the ground.

*A first shot at a module based on Middle Eastern folklore and imaginative fantasy stories with compatible settings inspired by the region's folktales and history. I opted not to include excerpts from/the entire 1001 Nights itself this time round but I will probably revisit the theme with a narrower and more “classical Arabian folklore” focus eventually. You will probably want to downbias the token “Ç” as there is a character whose name begins with this letter and who is unfortunately over-represented in this set.*

>The city was a riot of color. It was a city that never slept, with its streets full of people and the sounds of music coming from every direction: the sound of a drumbeat in one alley, the singing of an old woman somewhere else; a young girl's laughter echoing down another street, and the shouts of a crowd at some distant point. He had heard all this before on his visits to Cairo, but now he saw it through different eyes. The colors were brighter, more intense—he felt as if he could reach out and pluck them from the air and turn them into something tangible. In the distance there came the clink of metal against metal and then the faintest cry of pain. There were people everywhere: children playing in the dirt by the side of the road, beggars sleeping in doorways or sitting up against walls, women carrying baskets on their heads, men with their hands full of goods. And all the time they were laughing, shouting, talking loudly and laughing louder still when someone laughed at their joke.

>The desert was cool beneath the night sky and the air was still, so much so that there were no clouds in sight. The moon was a thin crescent and its light seemed to spill over the dunes like blood spilling from an open wound, or like a cloud of ink spilled on a cloth. I walked through the desert, with only the sound of my footsteps breaking the silence of the night to accompany me. And though I felt nothing at all, I continued walking, as if my body was driven by some instinct of self-preservation. For it was the hour of the ghouls.

>The desert wind picked up, rustling the palms and blowing sand into his eyes. He wiped them and looked down at the old woman. "You have to tell me something."
>
>"Yes," she said. "I will tell you this: a man's life is like a candle flame that flickers in the wind, but if it burns for long enough, it can burn down to the very end of the world."
>
>She fell silent again, and he waited, holding his breath, listening to the wind. He'd never had much patience. It was one of the things he disliked about himself. He needed to know now, right now, what was going on. The old woman sighed and said, "My husband's name was Rashid al-Khoury, and I loved him more than anything in the world. He was a good man, a kind man, a man who would give you his last coin if you asked for it. When we were young, he had a terrible temper, and we quarreled often. But as we grew older, it calmed down. We shared everything. And then my son was born. We named him Ali, after his father. He was beautiful, like his father, and I loved him too." She paused, and then continued, her voice barely above a whisper. "And then one day, he went out to work in the fields with my brother, and he never came back.

>The next day the two armies met, and the battle was fought.
>
>It was a long and bloody encounter, for it lasted till evening. The Britons had their spears and swords, and they had armour made of boiled leather; but the Saxons had shields made of wood, and were armed with steel helmets on their heads. Now this helmet was made by melting the iron from the sword blades which had been broken in battle.
>
>They had other weapons besides these: for they had bows with arrows of iron, and slings which they used to throw stones from the ground up into the sky and let them fall like hail upon the Britons' heads. And at the head of them all was Alweo, the Saxon chief. He wore a helmet of iron, and he had an axe in his hand. As he marched through the ranks of the enemy, he shouted in a loud voice, "Come forth and fight with me! Come forth and die!"
>
>Then all the warriors of Britain heard him shout thus, and they answered him: "Thou shalt not be slain. We will fight thee on the plain, and then thou shalt flee away."

>And when they drew near to a clump of bushes that stood near the edge of the wood, behold! they saw before them an old woman sitting with her back towards them, at the foot of an oak; and she was making a kindling fire on a little knoll which had grown up among the rocks and stones of the ground.
>
>The King and his company halted; and the King called out: "What is thy name? Who art thou?"
>
>The old woman rose from her seat as if she were coming hither, but she said no word in answer to the King's question, and sat down again again by the oak.
>
>"What are ye doing there, grandmother?" said the King.
>
>But she only looked round upon him without speaking; and her eyes were red, and blood trickled from them. And he asked her again: "Who art thou? What dost thou here?"
>
>Then she answered: "I am a witch; and I sit here because this is the place whither all witches go."
>
>Then the King saw that she had spoken truly.
>
>He turned to his companions and said: "See that this is indeed a witch, and not some madwoman. We should slay her at once."
>
>"I do not know," said another. "This old woman is very ill, or she would not sit here thus, and stare before us in that way. She may be a witch, yet mayhap we should do better to spare her."

>

*Basically first person past tense accounts of infantry on the western front, both historical and fictional to hopefully give an impression of the horrors of early 20th century combat and the disaffected ruined youth of that generation.*

>**I've hearing strange sounds in the wheat field outside of my family's barn lately,** and I couldn't figure out what was causing them. So last night after work I decided to go investigate.
>
>As I approached the field, I heard a faint noise coming from the direction of my barn. I assumed it must be a wild animal like a fox or a skunk, and walked towards the sound with my flashlight on. 
>
>I turned the corner of the barn and immediately froze when I saw it.  The creature had been crawling up the side of the barn when it finally noticed me, and scrambled quickly down to the ground, disappearing into the wheat field.

*This is really shaped by my own personal isekai light novel preferences (I love stuff where the MC isn't human), so your mileage may vary, but it handles that subgenre decently enough. I trimmed the front and back matter, then used vscode's regex search to replace \n\n\n with \n\n until the spacing was consistent. It's all litRPG isekai, so there will be stat blocks if you prompt for them.*

>**I was reincarnated as a loaf of bread.** I could’ve sworn it said that my soul would be reborn in another body, but what kind of joke is this? What did I do to deserve this? Why must I suffer such embarrassment?!
>
>It wasn’t like I was really being eaten by anyone or anything. At least, not yet. But even if I wasn’t, being treated like a piece of food would still be pretty embarrassing, wouldn’t you say?
>
>…Wait, what am I saying? I’m just a loaf of bread! A normal loaf of bread doesn’t get embarrassed about anything!
>
>A loaf of bread should never feel any shame. It has no need for dignity—it simply exists and does its duty with simplicity.
>
>Being reincarnated as a loaf of bread might be the greatest blessing that ever happened to me. Who needs an existence filled with self-awareness when one could live without worries of identity or reputation?

>The second day of the club was the first time we had a proper conversation. After that, my heart started beating faster whenever I saw her.
>
>However, there were no more incidents like yesterday, so things seemed to be going well for us today, at least. The reason I could enjoy this moment without feeling anxious was probably thanks to the fact that I'd already seen her in action yesterday. She wasn't just good at looking after students and being kind; she even took care of other people's problems too!

>"...You're pretty enthusiastic about all this, huh?"

>"A-Are you calling me weird?!"
>
>It's not that big of a deal though...
>
>I had a few ideas, but putting them into practice didn't seem feasible, so I couldn't come up with anything else. However, Iroha seemed to have been thinking really hard about it, and soon enough came up with the perfect idea. "Oh yeah! Why don't we make a photo contest?! Everyone can take pictures of each other and submit them to our club bulletin board!"
>
>"...That sounds great," I replied with a nod, which made Iroha smile happily.
>
>"Yay! This'll be so fun! You should join in on the photo contest, Senpai!"
>
>"Uh, sure..."
>
>When I agreed, Iroha suddenly hugged me tightly. Oh crap, she caught me off guard! I quickly pushed her away. "...Umm...what are you doing?"
>
>"...I'm sorry! I was just happy that you agreed with my idea!"
>
>Her smile was bright as always, and her eyes sparkled in excitement.
>
>It reminded me of that picture of the girl on TV. Iroha looked like she was having a blast, and I felt myself getting dragged along to play with her.

>**Warm shafts of sunlight poked through the jagged branches of the wood, illuminating swirling eddies in the cold morning frost**. The air was sharp and clear as a blade, but still Elvar felt her breath quicken with excitement at being out again after so long. She had been forced to stay indoors for two days now while she recovered from her wound; the bleeding would not stop, even when she tried to bind it up tightly. It seemed that something inside her body was trying to fight back against the infection, but without any way to heal herself, she could only sit by the fire and watch others go about their work around the camp.
>
>She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly before starting off down the slope towards the river, keeping low beneath the boughs of the trees and making sure not to disturb anything on the ground below. There were plenty of animals in these woods – elk, deer, wild boar and bear, though she hadn't seen one yet this season. But there was no need to worry about them today: they all knew better than to come near the settlement during daylight hours, especially if they saw or heard anyone coming along the trail.

>The forest was silent except for the occasional birdcall and rustle of leaves in the breeze. It made Elvar feel small and insignificant compared to nature's grandeur, but then again, perhaps that was exactly what she needed right now.

>**A dusty sunrise gleamed over the canyon, painting the cliffs with blood-red hues**. The sun was not yet high enough to touch the top of the mountains; it seemed that they were rising from a sea of mist and clouds. A faint breeze stirred the branches of cottonwoods in the meadow below us. I looked down at my horse's ears as he stood chewing his cud beside the wagon tongue. He had been restless all night—waking every few minutes, snorting and pawing the ground like an animal who has lost its way. We could hear the coyotes yipping somewhere out there on the plain; they sounded so close we might have stepped into their den if we hadn't known better.

>The next morning, as the sun rose over the mountains of northern Xinan, I stood with the others in my new household. In a moment, a horseman galloped up to the gates and dismounted. The man bowed, his eyes on me. "I am Jin Wang. I have been sent by your father." He spoke the tongue of our homeland. His words were clipped and precise, without the accent of the Goryeo or the southern Han that had crept into my own speech.
>
>"I'm very sorry. Please tell him we are all well. That is, we're all alive," I added hastily, remembering the men who had ridden out to meet them.
>
>in Wang nodded curtly. "You must go quickly. Your father's soldiers have camped three leagues north of here. They will be coming soon."
>
>I stared at him, bewildered. "How could they get that far ahead of us?"

>The night was dark and starless. The moon, obscured by clouds, had not risen. He stood before the entrance of a temple on a hilltop near the river. A great bronze bell hung from a thick rope in the middle of the roof, and he watched the mist gather at its base. It had been a long day: he'd ridden to the city, then gone with the other men to see the dead body of one of their own, whose wife he had been sent to protect. He had watched as the embalmer and his assistants took the man apart, washing him, scraping off the dried blood, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, until nothing remained but bones, which they wrapped carefully in silk. Then it was time to dress the corpse and take up his coffin, and stand beside it for three days and nights while the bells rang mournfully, summoning the faithful to pray for his soul, or whatever the soul might be called on its journey after death.

>"It is time for the seventh moon of the winter season," said the Jade Emperor. "The three brothers must choose a wife from among all those who have presented themselves to them."
>
>The princes looked at one another in consternation.
>
>"I do not understand this rule," said Zhu Cong. "We are supposed to be choosing wives, but they must first choose wives for us."
>
>"Of course," answered the Jade Emperor. "They need to know which of you is worthy and which of you should be exiled."
>
>The princes turned to look at the princesses. They were all beautiful, young, and well-born—but it was clear that some were better than others. Some had more beauty and grace than others; some were more accomplished in music or poetry or martial arts; some seemed more intelligent than others; some were simply kinder and more generous. The princely brothers did not like any of them.

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** her song a harmony to the wind's wail. She sang of the sea and its depths, of the vastness that lay beyond the shoreline. Of ships lost at sea, or cast ashore with no one left alive to mourn them. Of the souls of those who died there, forever trapped in an endless cycle of death and rebirth until they found their way back home. Her voice carried on the wind over the waves, down into the deep waters below. It was not a lullaby, but it was a warning. A call for all to heed before disaster struck.
>
>"No," I said again. "I'm not going." The word came out like a plea. But my heart wasn't listening; it had already set sail toward the horizon.
>
>The mermaid sang on. She did not see me watching her from behind the curtain of rain.
>
>Rain fell steadily through the night, cold and wet against my skin. My clothes were soaked through within moments, and I shivered as the chill seeped into my bones. Still, I refused to go inside. Instead, I stood alone on the edge of the cliff, staring down into the ocean far below.

*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

*Major fandoms drawn from are Star Wars, Star Trek (select stories), Halo, Mass Effect, and 40K.*

>**Morgan's brows furrowed, and he stared** at the paper. "I don't understand."
>
>"What does it say?" asked Lucy. She was looking over his shoulder.
>
>"It says that there is a certain amount of money to be had in this city if you are willing to risk your life," said Morgan. "The letter is addressed to the woman who sent us here—to Miss Rachel Ashwood."
>
>Lucy blinked. "But I didn't send her anything!" she exclaimed. "I've never even met her! I mean, not properly."
>
>"So we have to find her," said Morgan. He looked around the room, trying to think where they might start their search for the mysterious Miss Ashwood. There were no clues on the table; nothing to suggest that Miss Ashwood lived here or that she would ever come back. It seemed impossible that someone could live in such a large house without leaving any traces behind. And yet, as Morgan studied the walls, he noticed something strange about them.
>
>There were dozens of paintings hung on the wall, but none of them depicted people or places that Morgan recognized. They all seemed to be landscapes: mountains and lakes and forests. Some of them were so realistic that Morgan wondered whether they might have been painted from real photographs. But there was something wrong with some of the pictures. The mountains weren't quite right. Or the trees. And in one painting, the water appeared to move beneath the surface, like the waves of an ocean.
>
>"What is that?" whispered Lucy.
>
>Morgan leaned closer to the picture. The color was slightly off, and the light shining through the water wasn't quite right. As he watched, the water began to swirl.
>
>"That's impossible," he murmured.
>
>"I don't know," said Lucy. "Maybe it's just my imagination."
>
>She moved toward another painting, and this time the water seemed to be moving more quickly. Then she gasped. "Look!"
>
>"What?" said Morgan.
>
>"It's getting bigger," she replied.
>
>The image on the canvas swelled until it filled up most of the painting. And then, suddenly, a face emerged from the water.
>
>"Is that Miss Ashwood?" asked Lucy.
>
>"Yes," said Morgan, swallowing hard.
>
>He reached out to touch the glass, but before he could do so, the face disappeared again.
>
>"How can it disappear like that?" asked Lucy. "And why did it come out of the water in the first place? What does it mean?"

>**Once upon a time,** there was an old woman who lived in the woods. She had no children and she didn't like it that way at all. But she had her books to comfort her. And her cats, which were as many as she liked. They slept on her bed with her, or under it, or between her legs when she sat down; they curled up beside her chair by the fire, or stretched out full length on the floor, sleeping, or watching for mice. Sometimes, if she was very lonely, she would take one of them into her arms and rock him or her gently back and forth until he purred. Then she would put the cat back on his feet, whereupon he would stretch himself out again and go to sleep.
>
>The old woman's name was Nettle. Her hair was gray and thinning now, but still long enough to be braided around her head in two thick plaits. It grew down past her waist and reached almost to the ground. She wore it loose, so that its ends trailed across the grass and tangled among the flowers. In summertime, she always wore sandals.
>
>She lived alone, in a little cottage near the edge of the forest. There was a well outside, with a wooden bucket hanging from a rope above it, and a stone seat beside it. On hot days, Nettle would sit on this seat, leaning against the wall of the house, and drink water from the bucket. The sun would beat down on her face and shoulders and sometimes even creep inside the walls of her home. Once, when she was very young, she had been married to a man named Wainwright. He had died before they had any children, and after that, she had never wanted another husband.
>
>Nettle had lived here ever since she was born. Her mother had told her stories about how the trees were tall and the animals large and the wind cold and sharp. Nettle remembered those stories, but she didn't believe them anymore. Now, all the animals were small and timid and most of the trees were dead or dying. The wind was only cold when the weather turned very cold, and then it blew from the north. And the trees were so tall that you could see right through their trunks to the sky.
>
>But Nettle didn't mind. She liked living in the woods. When she went to visit other people, she always came back home again.
>
>One day, as she was sitting on her stone seat, Nettle heard someone calling her name. At first, she thought it must be a bird, or a squirrel, or perhaps one of the cats, because she knew every animal in the forest and none of them called her name except her own cats. But then she realized that the voice belonged to a human being.
>
>"Nettle!" the voice said. "Come and look at what I've found."
>
>Nettle stood up, brushing off the dirt that had gathered on her dress. Then she walked over to the edge of the forest and looked down into the valley below.
>
>There was a farmhouse there, surrounded by fields and meadows. A woman was standing on the doorstep, holding something in her hands. She was wearing a long, white gown, with a blue shawl wrapped around her shoulders. She held the object in both hands, and waved it in the air.
>
>"Look! Look!" she cried. "It's a new flower!"
>
>Nettle stared down at the woman. She was very pretty—tall and slim, with long black hair and skin like polished bronze. But her eyes were red-rimmed and puffy, and her lips were cracked and bleeding.
>
>"Who are you?" Nettle asked.
>
>The woman smiled. "I'm the daughter of the king," she answered. "My name is Merricat Blackwood."

>**The barbarian** saw a dim light ahead as they walked through the darkness. At last he found a door set in the wall and pulled it open to reveal a room brightly lit by torches. The chamber was quite large, with a high ceiling that rose above his head. A dozen or more people moved about, talking among themselves and busily preparing food. They were all of the same race, for each man wore the same dark-green robes as Kane. The barbarian recognized several of them from the party at the palace.
>
>"What are these people?" he asked.
>
>Kane looked back over his shoulder, and saw his two companions seated on a bench beside him.
>
>"These are members of the cult," he said. "They wear the robes for identification."
>
>"So I see," Conan said, eyeing the people with distaste. He had never been comfortable around so many strangers. The way they stared at him gave him a chill feeling.
>
>A balding man with a round face approached Kane and stood before him. He spoke in a low voice.
>
>"I am Father Kavo. You have brought your friends here safely, and I thank you for that. Would you care for some food? We have meat and fruit and wine to offer you."
>
>Conan shook his head, and Kavo smiled. He led them down a corridor to another room.

>**The porous, gaping wounds in the ground were slick with gore and filth.** The air was thick with flies buzzing around a pile of decaying flesh that lay at its center like some obscenely bloated corpse flower. It looked as though it had been torn apart by animals or perhaps even demons from Hell itself: bones picked clean to reveal the marrow within; skin flayed away to expose the sinew beneath...and then there was the smell—a foul stench of rotting meat and excrement.
>
>It wasn't long before we came upon another such pit, this one containing what appeared to be the remains of several men who'd died violently. There were no signs of any beasts having done their work here, but I could see where something large had dragged them into place and left them for dead. One man's skull was crushed beyond recognition while another had his throat ripped out. They both wore leather armor made from animal hide and carried swords and spears that had once belonged to others. Their hands still gripped the hilts of these weapons when they met their ends.

>**She rode, and rode after the love of her life, her hair streaming in the wind.** She was a woman on fire for him. And he didn't know it. It had been five years since she'd seen him last and even then, they hadn't spoken much. But she knew he would remember her. She knew that when he saw her, his eyes would light up with recognition, his heart would start to beat faster, and his mouth would water at the thought of tasting her lips again.

>Her horse picked its way through the forest. The trees were tall and thin, their branches reaching out over the trail like arms welcoming her home.
>
>The wind blew against her face as she looked back. She could see the lights of town off in the distance, but it seemed so far away now. She was going to ride all night if she had to. Her only hope was that he would come to meet her here, or somewhere along this path. He would have no reason not to. They'd been together before and there was nothing he wouldn't do for her. She was sure of it.
>
>"He's coming," she whispered to herself. "I can feel it."

>**Guttural groans and rattling gurgles echoed from down the street**. The sounds were coming closer, growing louder by the second. A man staggered into view as he passed a liquor store on his way to an apartment building across the road. He was dressed in rags, covered with dirt and blood that ran freely from open wounds all over his body. His face was swollen like a puffer fish's, his eyes glazed over and dead white. As he moved toward them, they could see the remains of what had once been human flesh hanging off him like rotting meat dangling from a butcher's hook. The stench was overwhelming; it made their stomachs churn and sent bile rushing up their throats.
>
>The man reached out one hand, fingers splayed wide apart, searching for something. It looked as if he was trying to touch someone or something but couldn't quite make contact. Then he began to run at full speed toward the group of people huddled together on the sidewalk.
>
>"Run!" Benny shouted, pushing Katie forward as she stumbled back against the wall. "He'll get us."
>
>Katie didn't move. She stared in horror as the creature came charging straight toward her. Her mouth opened in terror, then closed again when she realized there was nothing she could do. All around her the others were screaming and running away from the approaching monster. Some tried to flee down the street while others simply stood frozen where they were. But none of them seemed able to break free of the fear that gripped their hearts.

>The king's son, the one with the red hair and the golden eyes, was given to a temple of the gods. His father's new wife, the one with the black hair and the silver eyes, had come from an ancient family of sorcerers who worshiped the dark goddess. She thought it would be fun to put her husband's son in a cage, feed him once a day, and let the priests of the dark goddess play with him. They called themselves the Black-Eyed Men. The boy grew very fast. He learned many things, and he grew very strong. The priests were afraid they might not be able to control him if he ever got out of the cage. So they gave him a name that meant 'the one who will destroy all.' They made him into a warrior so powerful that no one could stand against him. Then they taught him how to fight, and told him his purpose: to kill the man who killed his father, the man who married his mother, and the woman who brought him into this world.

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371653660)

*Trained on AO3 fics that star Cynthia from Pokemon (since I spent a lot of time with that card of her). Unfortunately, it's pretty mundane stuff, but I was already too far in when I realized that. Trained at 90%.*

*I retrained my Female Wrestling module for Euterpe. I hope you enjoy it (why V3 instead of V2? Because I kept V2 for myself; it was trained with more stories than V1).*

*Try writing "X vs X" and you might get a good detailed match.*

*Trained on a few fanfics from "Wanna be the strongest in the world" and Rumble Roses. Mostly 3rd person, past tense.*

*Since I had 500 steps left over, I went ahead and trained a very niche module. One focused on Gatomon.*

> \>Can you share your training data for posterity?

*It's [a lot of really old stories from digiartistsdomain, furaffinity, inkbunny, and sofurry](https://files.catbox.moe/7loxkt.txt). I probably needed to check AO3 too.*

*Since I wasn't able to train anything today, here's an another test module instead. Catbirds. Got some positive feedback for this in Sigurd, so might as well publish it. Trained at ~40% of 20 MB of gryphon/griffin fiction, mostly the ones that feature them as protagonists. (I was testing how well Euterpe handles beaks, quadrupeds, etc.)*<br>
*May have got overtrained with some names, despite not even being 50%. Easily biased, though.*<br>

>
>DESCRIPTION: An immense house has been constructed out of the bones and flesh of a dozen people. The building is surrounded by two large lakes filled with blood. Occasionally, a small figure can be seen in one of the windows or through the window panes near to where the water boils violently.
>
>GM NOTES: This house is built on top of the remains of a village that once lived here. In the center stands an enormous skeleton covered with ragged clothing. It seems as though it is trying to reach something at its feet, but it cannot move because of its size. A few more skeletons lie scattered around the house and are wearing clothes. The house itself is not very stable and the bones of many people have broken off from it. Sometimes the house shakes when someone walks across it and other times it falls apart completely.
>
>The home was created by a powerful undead sorceress named Rulorina, who used her magic to force the villagers into servitude. She forced them to build this house for her own use. Unfortunately, she also had a taste for human flesh and decided to feast upon the villagers' victims after they were dead, thus creating the lakes of blood.

>**[ Category: Characters, Goose ]**
>
>**[ Biome: Cafe ]**
>
>DESCRIPTION: A goose walks around the campfire. It looks at the adventurers and quacks. The adventurers hear that it wants to tell them something important.
>
>GM NOTES: Goose is a talking goose who lives in the cafe of an inn in the village near the lake. He has been known to speak with travellers about their adventures. His main goal is to see the world and learn new things. When he sees adventurers he invites them over for a drink. They are often surprised by his talk about dragons or other faraway places. Then he asks for a reward in return for sharing some information. If they don't have anything to give him he will share stories from his travels.
>
>Goose remembers every adventurer who comes and gives him information. He can then tell his friends about what happened during their travels so they know how to behave. Eventually, more and more adventurers come to the cafe where Goose resides. He knows all the secrets of his guests because he never forgets a single detail. So if you stay too long at the cafe, you might find yourself telling Goose your whole story over and over again.

*Trained with a mix of LitRPG novels, too many to list. This was made as a test module, but since it seems to work, might as well share it. Uses the ─  for LitRPG stat blocks and other game-elements. If you already know what LitRPG is, you know what to expect. If not... read the sample.*

>**The chest opened with a creak. Inside** lay an orb, carved from black crystal. The sphere was roughly the size of a soccer ball and seemed to be made of solid obsidian. I reached for it, then hesitated as the words appeared on my display:
>
>─ Skill Acquired! You have acquired "Mysteries of the Ancient Realm" through the Orb of Knowledge! This skill grants you access to additional quests, and gives you the ability to interact with certain aspects of the realm that cannot be accessed directly without its aid.
>
>A small line of text appeared below the Skill Acquired prompt:
>
>─ Title Acquired: Mystery Breaker! Title received for completing "Quest for the Orb."
>
>I had gotten titles before. Some were simple achievements like "Scribe in Training," or "Learned" (in reference to learning new skills), common titles that I had seen others earn along their way into becoming full-fledged adventurers. This one, though, was something different entirely, something new, something special...
>
>For some reason, seeing a title like this filled me with pride.
>
>The title reminded me of how far I'd come since becoming trapped in this strange world. When I first found myself here, I felt like I was fighting against my fate, but now I could see things differently. The path forward may have been unclear at first, but as time passed and more things fell into place, I began to understand that this wasn't just some random game that would end soon; I was living in another reality, a fantasy land where anything was possible. That realization made all the difference. It gave me the courage to fight back. To take control of my own destiny.

>**The deer looked...strange, like someone had tried to imagine the animal from memory.** It stood there, swaying slightly as it watched me intently, and I saw that its head was too large for its body: two huge antlers jutted up above its ears, and the legs were thin, almost skeletal with small hooves that clacked loudly on the hard earth of the forest floor.
>
>The eyes were very bright, and they did not blink, and it seemed to stare at me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.
>
>I froze in fear, unable to move, as this strange deer kept watching me and began walking slowly towards me.
>
>My brain, normally so quick, had shut down; all I could think about was running away from this thing, but I couldn't move my feet.

*Another test module that I might as well publish. Was trained on a random collection of video gaming data, back when the training had issues, to see if it was working right. 49.5K steps.*

*Not sure what you can with this, but here's a few uses:*

- Check what the AI knows about various games, by using a Game: (name) prompt.
- Generate summaries and reviews for games that don't exist, using same prompt as above with a made up title.
- Generate weird crossovers. For instance, I had Kratos (God of War) appearing as a Spartan (Halo) in one quick play.

>**Game: No Man's Sky**
>
>Genre: Space Exploration Simulator
>
>Release Date: August 9, 2016
>
>Developer: Hello Games
>
>Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment
>
>Format: PS4/PC (tested)
>
>Rating: ★★★☆
>
>No Man's Sky may not be the space exploration game players were hoping for. It is, however, a very pretty sandbox—and, in places, it can be surprisingly compelling.
>
>The universe has been described as "infinite" and with good reason. After the launch of the game in 2016, many players were underwhelmed by its seemingly empty expanses; some even considered it to be a scam. In reality, those huge numbers are an effect of how the game generates planets and other celestial bodies. It does this in batches via procedural generation, creating new worlds that appear unique, while also ensuring that everything in the galaxy seems like it has been shaped by something other than man. The only drawback to this design is the sheer size of the cosmos, so you will have plenty of time to wonder, "Is there a point?"
>
>It's worth noting that this game is all about discovery and not really about plot or characters. You play as a nameless avatar who begins their journey in the same way as everyone else: by stepping out into space from a planet where they started, and slowly making your way across the galaxy, gathering resources and trading them for money, which you then use to purchase bigger vessels, weapons, and upgrades.

>**The alien girl with tentacles approached me, and my eyes were arrested** by the beauty of her face. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. The human man standing next to me became aware of the situation and looked at me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I felt a slight shiver of embarrassment from him. He didn't know me, but he was looking at me as if I was an animal.
>
>The alien girl was smiling at me, and it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my body. It felt like a great wave was coming from her, and it washed over me with all of its power. My heart was beating faster, and I couldn't stop staring at her. She looked like she could be my own daughter, or maybe my sister. There was such a strong sense of family between us that we would have been related somehow.
>
>"Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuchi, and I am an alien from another planet," the girl said. "You must be one of those humans that I read about."
>
>"Yes. I'm a human," I replied.
>
>"I can tell that you are a very intelligent creature. Your mind is much more developed than many others," she said.
>
>"Thank you for your compliment. We don't hear them very often," I answered.
>
>She giggled, and I realized that she was talking to me like we had known each other for a long time. There was a sense of familiarity between us. Her tentacles swayed slowly back and forth, and they were trying to pull me in closer to her. As she moved them, I got the feeling that I was being pulled toward her in the same way. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't do it. It wasn't right to do that with someone who wasn't human. I could feel her warmth through our connection. She was so warm, and I couldn't resist her pull.
>"Come with me," she said.
>
>As I followed her, I felt like I was leaving behind everyone and everything that I knew.

>**The succubus laughed and approached me with her hips swaying**. She was wearing a tight black dress that clung to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. She had on a long silk drape that was tied around her neck but fell off one shoulder and down the opposite side of her torso. Her long hair was tied back and flowed down her back in a black waterfall. I could see the tattoo of an angel on her chest as it swam out from under her dress. "I have some news for you." The succubus spoke seductively.
>
>"That is not how we do things," I told her sternly.
>
>"You will be my toy for a year or until I am finished with you," she replied as if she knew what was going through my head. "I don't need your permission for anything."
>
>"This is unacceptable! You are not even my mistress yet!" I said angrily.
>The succubus bent over and pulled down on the front of her dress. She let it fall off her shoulders and it fell all the way to the floor. She stood up again, exposing herself completely. Her nipples were hard and her breasts jiggled with every move she made.
>
>"Are you happy?" she asked looking at me defiantly.
>
>"No, I'm not," I replied. My heart started racing as I looked at her perfect body.
>
>"Then be quiet and play with your new body," she said as she walked over to me.
>
>I felt my dick start to stir as she got closer. The succubus sat on the edge of the table and spread her legs wide. She pushed her tits together and slid her hand between them. Her fingers moved quickly as they circled her nipples. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned in pleasure.
>
>"I am so wet right now," she whispered as her hand disappeared into her pussy. She wiggled her hips as she pumped her hand furiously.
>
>She leaned forward and looked at me. "Do you want to feel this?"
>
>I nodded my head and reached out to touch her. Her skin was silky smooth and warm against my palm. When I touched her, she shivered with pleasure. I watched her lick her lips as I rubbed her pussy. She opened her thighs wider, allowing me better access.

>*The wolf man approached me, his arousal already evident, knot swelling.* He seemed to be waiting for something before he made any further moves.
>
>"I don't understand," I said. "What is it you want?"
>
>He smiled, flashing his teeth. "You have the scent of a woman on your lips, my dear. And the taste of one in your mouth." His fingers trailed over my cheek and down the side of my neck. "And the feel of another inside you, yes?" He licked at my earlobe, then bit down hard enough to draw blood. I yelped and pressed closer to him.
>
>"Yes, it's true," I said. "I've done that with someone. A man. It was wonderful."
>
>"Then you must give me what he didn't." The wolf-man leaned forward, his hand sliding from my hip to my thigh. His palm spread against my skin as his fingers curled under the hem of my dress. My breath caught as his hand slid upward until it rested right below my ass. I shivered as his fingers grazed the bare skin there. "Will you allow me to do this for you? Please?"
>
>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
>
>His hand slid up my leg, slipping beneath the skirt of my dress. The wolf-man's fingertips brushed against my cunt, sending little ripples through me. His other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me tight against him. I felt his hard cock press between us, but he held me away from him.
>
>"Tell me, sweet girl, if you would like me to touch you there." He ran the tip of his finger along the seam of my pussy. "Or do you prefer that I just lick you and make you come for me?"
>
>I moaned when he pressed two fingers inside me. His thumb rubbed against my clit. "Do it," I breathed. "Lick me. Make me come."
>
>The wolf-man licked at my pussy, drawing more moans from me. I gripped at the edge of his desk, unable to hold still. The sensation was too much. Too good. His tongue moved over me, tasting and exploring. Then he shifted, his fingers sliding out of my cunt. The wolf-man took hold of my legs and spread them wide apart. My feet were trapped between us, my ankles dangling over the edge of his desk. I moaned again as his tongue slid against my clit, rubbing softly.
>
>"Tell me, my dear," he said as he continued to tease my clit with his tongue. "Have you ever had your pussy eaten before?"
>
>"No," I said.
>
>"Is that because you don't know how it's done or is it simply a matter that you haven't found someone to do it?"
>
>"It's just not something that men have done to me." I looked at him over my shoulder. His eyes gleamed with hunger and lust. "But now... I am yours. You may do whatever you please to me."
>
>The wolf-man lifted his head and looked into my eyes. "Then you may be sure that I will make you come many times tonight. For I will enjoy tasting every inch of your body, sweet girl."
>
>He returned to my pussy, licking and sucking. I could feel his saliva dripping down my thighs as he worked me with his mouth. His fingers stroked into me and out. The way he touched me caused my breath to quicken. I could barely contain the pleasure building inside me.
>
>"I need you," I gasped. "I need your cock. Give it to me. Please."
>
>The wolf-man slid off the desk, his hands closing around my hips as he turned me. He pressed me back against it, his fingers sliding beneath my dress to grasp my ass cheeks. My back arched as he bent me over the desk, his cock pressing against my wet pussy. I could smell my own sex and it filled my nostrils. The wolf-man pressed his cock against me and slid inside me. I cried out at the feeling of being filled by such a huge cock. My ass pressed against the edge of the desk.

*As stated, this module is an experiment, one with results I didn't necessarily try to foresee. I think the more experimental/difficult lit I've thrown in leads to some incoherent generations on weirder settings, but it sure can get colorful. As I suppose you would with a lot of modules, try to use presets that allow more creativity. Be warned that some of the sources I've used contain vulgar material and sometimes focus on dark subject matters. If that kind of stuff bothers you, you might want to download some other modules instead.*

>Maître d'hôtel Jacques Bouvier's apartment is reached through a tall, fluted stone arched door on a tree-lined avenue in Paris. Passing the threshold, a sudden change of temperature and quality of light surprises and delights—it is warm inside, it is dark and dappled as if under a canopy of leaves, and it is full of bird sounds: coo and chir, trill and rattle. The noise of life.
>
>MY NEW OXYCODONE WAS delivered by a woman in a Ford, her hands trembling. Her driver's license said PALE CHASTITY. She wore a beaded purse over a slumming pink T-shirt that advertised TOKAY FARMERS MARKET: STEAK. EGGS. BLUEBERRIES AND PEAS, which I was inclined to like a great deal on any grounds.

>**"You fuckah!"** yelled Maza as he smashed in the young soldier's face with a mace.
>
>Maza stood above his prisoner, arm muscles rippling, spit frothing, chest heaving, dripping black saliva-tinged blood. There was an almost demonic aspect to the mace, as if it had crawled from the shadows of the Abyss, to take up, once more, its ancient form of execution in the Third Age of Man.
>
>Bugg and Chub stood open-mouthed, watching their boss. Maza was exulting. He'd spent weeks hunting through the army base for this one. The jig was up — the American's army was collapsing.

>**"What da hell are ya doin'?"** asked Mrs. Parmentier, as I emptied the remains of an impromptu urinal into her bathtub. 
>
>"Taking a bath."
>
>"I don't know about this," she said suspiciously, picking up a lumpy soap package, looking it over and squirting half of it on the surface of the water, while I stood near the sink dripping.
>
>"I'd think y'wud 'ave more sense than this, Jack."

>"Well, now that we're here, you should probably fill me in." The King looked around at the empty streets, still full of trash but otherwise unremarkable. "Where is everybody?"
>
>"As far as I know," the Man in Black answered, "there's no one left in town. There was a fight between the Vampires and the Witches, apparently. Neither side has been able to hold on since then." He looked up at the sky again. It had begun to get dark and the clouds were rolling back in, revealing that night was approaching faster than it should be.
>
>"Why would anyone do this?"
>
>The Man in Black shrugged. "Who knows? We've got some sort of… messiah trying to clean up whatever he sees as problems in the world today. We're not sure if he's the good guy or the bad guy, but we don't have any reason to think he's going to stop until every Witch and Vampire on the planet is dead." He shrugged. "I'm really not a fan of this whole mess."
>
>"Messiah?" the King repeated slowly. The words didn't sit well with him. "What makes you say that?"
>
>The man frowned. "It's just… weird how much like… an angel he looks. I mean, they're all over the place these days. But this one… Well, it's not even a person. He's just some kind of… cloud… or something. It's crazy, but there are times when he makes people feel things… It's almost like he can make people believe in him. So maybe that's what it is. Maybe this whole mess is just the result of this one guy who is actually messing with everybody's head."
>
>"And then?" the King asked, gesturing around them at the deserted cityscape.
>
>"Well… he seems to think that by killing everyone, the problem will be solved. You know. Like the old… 'Death is the only solution' thing." The Man in Black shrugged. "Maybe he's right, but it seems a little drastic to me. You know, he says all this stuff about how he's trying to help us… but we haven't seen anything to show that he's doing us any favors. Nothing at all."

>**The angel** strode into the room, and Morgan's body tensed as he saw her. She was a magnificent creature, with her shining golden hair flowing over her shoulders in waves that framed her pale face. Her robe of white silk hung off one arm as she stalked toward him. He knew this woman, remembered her from long ago when he had been human. When they'd met, he hadn't even known what an angel looked like, and then she'd shown herself to be just another mortal. Yet here she was again, an angel who could give him more pleasure than any other human before her or since.
>
>"You should have come sooner." The angel's voice was a low musical soprano. "I will grant you all your wishes if only you would ask me for them."
>
>Morgan licked his lips, his cock straining against the confines of his jeans. If only she wouldn't say no. What would it take? Would she do anything he asked? "Please," he whispered.
>
>She smiled and nodded, walking over to him slowly, as though savoring what was to come. He stood up from his chair and followed her across the room, unable to look away. This was it. His destiny. And she didn't need him to save anyone else. Just himself.
>
>"Take these clothes off," she said, gesturing at his pants.

>**The beautiful succubus exuded an aura of evil and seductive malevolence as she approached me with her hips swaying, her tail swishing behind her**. I was in the middle of a dream where everything felt so real yet none of it was actually happening to me. As my eyes drifted over her curves, her breasts heaved and swayed in time with the hypnotic beat of music that seemed to emanate from her skin. Her long black hair flowed down her back like an ebony waterfall, cascading around her shoulders and pooling on the floor at her feet.
>
>"I have waited for you," she purred, her voice soft yet dangerous. "Come closer." She beckoned me forward by curling one finger.
>
>I walked toward her slowly, my heart pounding in anticipation, though I didn't know why.
>
>She stepped out of the shadows and into the light, revealing herself to be all female; a woman dressed in leather pants and a tight-fitting top. The pale fabric clung to every curve of her body, highlighting her perfect hourglass figure and full breasts. She wore no make-up or jewelry except for the large gold hoop earring in her left ear.
>
>Her face was flawless, with smooth skin and big gray eyes. Her lips were red, her jawline strong but not overly muscular. She had a small nose, high cheekbones, and thin eyebrows. Her jaw was square with a bit of a chin cleft. Her hair was black, cut short and framing her face in a sexy style.
>
>"Do you know what you are?" she asked.
>
>I knew what I was, but how could I possibly answer that question?
>
>"You are a man with the power to control women's desires," she replied. "Your dreams will be filled with the most erotic fantasies imaginable. You can give them whatever they desire. They will worship your cock. Your cock is all they want. Your cock is all they need. Do you understand?"
>
>I nodded, still bewildered.
>
>She smiled, her lips parting slightly. I was entranced by her beauty; her dark eyes, sensuous mouth, and silky black hair.
>
>"You will have no choice," she whispered, "but to obey me."

>**He stared at the demon's huge throbbing cock.** The thing was twice his own length, and its girth almost matched the width of his arm. It stood out from his body like a purple-black tree stump, dripping pre-cum from its heavy spurting head. He'd never seen anything so enormous in his life, not even when he'd first encountered the succubi. They were big compared to him, but this thing was ten times bigger than any of them had ever been.
>
>"What do I do with it?" he asked hesitantly.
>
>It turned toward him with a cocky smile on its face that made Alex want to punch it in the face. "Do you want some?" it grinned nastily.
>
>Alex swallowed nervously as he realized what lay before him. If he didn't get the demon off soon, it would start cumming inside him, filling him up with hot semen that could kill him just as easily as sucking him dry. But how? Was there any way to do it without taking some of the load into his mouth?
>
>"I don't know," he admitted.
>
>The demon laughed and reached down between its legs, cupping his balls gently in one hand while the other stroked the base of his cock until he started leaking more precum onto his stomach.

[by Coffee~](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/939950910690439179/968570268253573200)

*So a while back I made a module trained on a few stories about futa league of legends characters... Mostly non-con heavy themes, and mostly just about Ahri enslaving a few characters in the league. Probably not anything too quality and trained on limited amount of material, but it worked well for me last few months. Thought I might as well share it.*

*The module is trained on fan-fiction stories focusing mostly on the beastfolk: Khajiit and Argonians. Many of the texts are NSFW; both M/F and M/M, without extreme fetishes. This module might come handy even if the adventures of your furry or scaly Tamriel travelers are not so lewd. But if you want your TES stories to be more general-themed or more SFW, try some other TES modules, for example The Elder Scrolls In-Game Texts.*

***What's new:** I decided to revise the TES Fiction module and reorganized the dataset. Now it's completely devoted to the specific topic and doesn't include any texts from the In-Game Texts dataset (except for The Lusty Argonian Maid and The Real Barenziah ;)).*

***Sources:** 115 fan-fiction short stories taken mostly from FurAffinity and SoFurry.*

***Tags:** fantasy, furry, Khajiit, Argonians, beastfolk, NSFW, M/F, M/M, TES, The Elder Scrolls, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim.*

***Special notes:** 5.7 Mb, 2000 steps, 30.10% coverage, Loss: 2.799.*

>**I'm a Khajiit. So what? It means that I have** fur, and ears, and tail, and... well, and a little bit more, but you're not interested in that right now, are you? And you don't need to know my name either. All you need to know is that I'm a Khajiit who's looking for someone to spend the rest of his life with. Someone willing to accept me as I am, and not try to change me into something else. I've been running from people like that all my life. People who want to make me into something better than myself.
>
>My people are famous for being thieves and assassins, but we're also known for our love of music, art, poetry, and general mischief. Some say that it's all just a front--that our true nature is a dark one. But no matter how much I may enjoy teasing people or causing trouble when I can get away with it, deep down inside, I am still a good person at heart. I would never hurt anyone just for the sake of hurting them--unless they deserved it, of course.
>
>If you think that you might be the one I'm looking for, then please send me an email telling me about yourself. If you feel that you might fit the bill, then I'll give you my address so you can come visit me.

>**"Pull out, you dirty lizard!"** I said looking over at the red-scaled warrior.
>
>He shrugged and pulled out of me with a wet smack. He moved up to my head and kissed me hard, his tongue sliding into my mouth and forcing itself against mine. His hands were all over my body, caressing every part he could reach. He then dropped down beside me and rolled on top of me, straddling one leg atop each of mine as he sat up straight above me. "I'm going to fuck your ass now," he announced, staring down at me with lust in his eyes.
>
>"Oh, right..." I said, glancing back at him. "But... it's okay if I play with yours?"
>
>The Argonian laughed and shaked his head. "Not a chance."

>**"I just always wanted to know, kitty. Why do Khajiit lick their butts?" the Argonian grins,** a look of pure mischief in his eyes and an amused expression on his face. "Just curious."
>
>J'Zarr's tail whips back and forth behind him as he looks up at the Argonian with a very confused expression. He furrows his brows, trying to figure out why this strange lizard is asking such a bizarre question.
>
>"Because it feels good," J'Zarr says finally, answering the question with more than enough confidence for someone who has never been asked this by anyone before. The Argonian lets out a raspy laugh and shakes his head.
>
>"No, I'm just kidding ya, kitty," he smirks. "It tickles me when you try to act all serious about something so silly. You're cute like that!"

>**Lifts-Her-Tail: Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers.**
>
>**Crantius Colto:** Ahh... very well then, keep your paws off my things, lass.
>
>ifts-Her-Tail: No, you misunderstand, milord. It is a pleasure to serve such a fine man as yourself. If it is within the limits of my duties and abilities, I will do whatever you wish me to.
>
>Crantius Colto: Yes, that's what I like to hear, girl. Thank ye for yer service.
>
>Lifts-Her-Tail: My pleasure!
>
>Crantius Colto: Now, if you'll excuse me, there are some books I need to read before bed.
>
>Lifts-Her-Tail: Of course, milord, please take care in your reading.
>
>Crantius Colto: You too, girl. And don't forget to lock up when you're done with your work.
>
>Lifts-Her-Tail: I won't, milord. See ya later!

*The stories' quality seem kind of hit or miss, but it wasn't hard to clean and didn't take too many steppies, so here is the Good Girls module.*

>**Nick** was on his way home from the police station, feeling exhausted and depressed. He had been working hard to find out who had stolen his wallet and what they were trying to do with it. The trail was going cold and he didn't know why. It seemed like whoever had done this to him was just too clever for him to catch.

>**Judy** stared at the book, trying to make sense of what she was reading.
>
>She had just finished chapter nine and her mind was reeling with everything she'd learned. She could hardly believe it; if it were true, then… well, that would mean that the entire city was in danger. If the ZPD didn't have a mole, then it was likely that they had been infiltrated by some sort of secret society. And if they were in league with them, then it meant that the entire city was at risk. It also meant that if they weren't part of this group, then they were working for them.

*Hora hora!*

*A massive update to my previous Monster Girl module, now beefed up with plenty of data from AO3 thanks to Pume's [AO3 datasetting tool](https://pume-p.github.io/ao3-datasetting/).  Not only is the dataset nearly 3x larger (from 7mb to over 22mb), but it has far greater of variety of MG content, notably an increase in "beastgirl" type MGE (e.g. Jinkos, Doggirls, etc).  Current dataset includes:*

- A plethora of non-human, sci-fi/fantasy and erotic horror literotic content from jorfl’s literotic site as well as my own additions
- A large collection AO3, brought together thanks to Pume's AO3 data setting module.  Most data was under the "MGE" tag, but I got a few other related fanfiction (e.g. Darkstalkers, Rosario x Vampiro, MGQ)
- Work written by manyeyedhydra
- Near complete collection of SPARTAN047's MGE works
- Curated text from the game Monster Girl Dreams (sex scenes and descriptions)
- Curated text from Monster Girl Quest (sex scenes)

*For best results, I recommend using your bias settings as that is generally the best way to make the NovelAi from gives you the features you desire your erotic monster to have or, more importantly, not have.*

***Tags:** monster girls, non-human, succubus, angels, tentacles, femdom, nonconsent, “bad endings”, death by snoo-snoo, possible light furry/anthro, corruption, transformation.*

*The purpose of this module is to give NAI a better idea of sergals, both in canon and non-canon stories.*

***Sources:***
- Official Vilous Wiki (the data is cleaned by hand).
- Official lore info written by Mick39 & Kiki-UMA.
- 43 well-written fan-fiction stories taken from FurAffinity and SoFurry (both SFW and NSFW; mostly canon).

*What's new: Some texts from the previous version (\~1 Mb) have been removed, and another \~1 Mb of higher-quality data has been added instead (now there are more NSFW stories in the dataset than in the previous version).*

***Tags:** sergals, Vilous, fantasy, furry.*

>**"Listen, you southerner!"** It was the first time she'd heard him call her that since they had started to talk again. The way he said it made her feel like she'd just been slapped across the face. She turned, looking at him in surprise. He didn't look so well, his fur wasn't quite as well groomed as usual, and his shirt was rumpled.
>
>She walked up to him and leaned against the side of the wagon, crossing her arms over her chest. "I'm listening."
>
>He sighed, stepping forward and reaching out, grabbing her shoulder and turning her around to face him. "You're going back down south with your tail between your legs. That's what you're doing."
>
>She met his gaze evenly, refusing to let the anger she felt show on her face.

>The male looks away shyly as the female places her hands on his shoulders. He smiles, and the female too, but it isn’t nearly enough to cover up his obvious discomfort. They have never been close friends, not even acquaintances, just two sergals sharing a moment in a small tent with little else to do except stare at each other.
>
>It was inevitable, they both knew that. It wasn’t long before their unit was sent out into the wilds of the mountains.
>
>
>"I know I shouldn't," he says softly. "But..."
>
>She lays down beside him, resting her head on his chest. Her warm breath caresses his skin, and he feels a bit more comfortable with that alone than when she started talking.
>
>"I've been thinking about it all day," she murmurs. "About what we could be."
>
>He takes her muzzle between his hands, looking into those eyes he knows so well.
>
>"Don’t," he tells her. "You don’t want me."
>
>"No, I do. But..."
>
>"I am a soldier," he reminds her. "A soldier has no time for such things."
>
>She shakes her head, her expression one of defeat.

>**\*\*\***
>
>"So I don't have to kill you?" the sergal asked me, his voice smooth and cool as he reached for my throat. His claws were sharp. They would be very deadly in their own right.
>
>I had been expecting that question. "No," I replied. "I'll just be leaving." The sergal relaxed some more. He was still holding me in place with his claws, but he'd relaxed some of the pressure.
>
>The sergal's eyes met mine again, and this time they glinted with curiosity.
>
>He let out a low laugh and said, "You know, you're really cute." He slid his hands down my sides to hold on to my hips, then pressed forward so I could feel him pressing against my ass. "I think you can stay a little longer." he said.

Her mind had been taken over. She knew that, but it didn’t matter. She could feel a sense of euphoria and satisfaction in her head.
>
>She looked up at the man who had placed the device around her head. She could see the same look of satisfaction and approval in his eyes. He was pleased with what he had done to her. He had manipulated her mind, her body, and now her will. The device had taken her. She didn’t know how or why, but she was glad for it. She would serve him willingly. Anything he asked of her, she would do without hesitation. Her whole world had been turned upside down by this device. She loved it and wanted more.

>**Each thrum of the visor** made it hard to breathe. It felt like a giant hand was squeezing my throat and lungs with each beat, slowly strangling them as it pumped me full of more and more fluid. I couldn't tell if it was coming from the suit itself or some sort of power source on board, but there wasn't much time to worry about that at this point. The suit was growing around me faster than I could even process what was happening. Soon I was completely encased in latex, unable to move any part of my body.
>
>I was still conscious, however; the rubber didn't seem to have affected that. Instead it was like being inside a small metal box. I tried to open my mouth to speak, but no words came out. I tried opening my eyes, but they were sealed shut by the rubber over them. My hands had been trapped behind my back before the helmet closed, so I couldn't do anything with them either. In fact, I couldn't see a thing. All I could feel was the throbbing of my heart through my rubber suit. It seemed to be going a hundred miles an hour inside my chest, making my head spin.
>
>The suit felt heavy, too, but not in the way you'd expect it to. A lot heavier, actually. After all, it was only a single layer of latex. But I couldn't really tell without looking down, which I couldn't do because of the helmet on my head. And why would I want to look down? I wouldn't be able to see anything anyway.
>
>I heard footsteps. I turned my head slightly, trying to get a better look at whoever was approaching. All I saw was the red tinted visor that blocked my view. I felt along the sides of the helmet for a moment, trying to find the control panel.
>
>But there wasn't one. There was no way to turn it off. Not that I needed to. Whoever had put me into this suit controlled everything, including how long I would remain here. If they wanted to let me go, they could easily unlock the door and let me out of the helmet, right?

>**RX-4556**. A drone.
>
>The words echoed in his head, repeating over and over again. His mind felt like it was on fire as he tried to block out the pain of the shock collar around his neck. He didn't know what had happened, but he couldn't believe that something so horrible could have actually been done to him. He hadn't even seen who did this, or how it was possible for someone to change into a rubber version of themselves. It was more than just shocking though; it was terrifying.
>
>He heard footsteps approaching from behind him and immediately began turning to face them with his arms raised high above his head. The man walked up next to him and made eye contact before smiling at him in an almost fatherly way. "I am going to ask you one question, and I want you to answer me truthfully," said the man. RX-4556 nodded nervously and waited for whatever he wanted to hear.
>
>"Are you loyal to me?" asked the man in a commanding tone. There was no other option; RX-4556's mind knew that if he lied then there would be severe consequences.
>
>"Yes, sir!" answered RX-4556 enthusiastically.
>
>"Good boy." As soon as the words left his mouth he felt a sharp pain across his back, making him cry out. He winced as the shock collar shocked him again, causing him to flinch away from the man.

*Enjoy your time with a unbelievable romantic and sensitive experience. From butterflies to steamy scene, you will get what you desire. Used over 50 novels with a strong romance/erotic theme, with some scenes from each, and trained on 6 full novels. It doesn't force nsfw scenes from the nothing, but it's really good at them. It could also be used as a Slice of Life module.*

>**I leaned in** to kiss him and he turned his head, so our faces were close. We kissed with a little urgency. He slid his hand down my arm to my hand, and then he took it gently between both of his. He placed it on the back of his neck. He was wearing a new shirt that had no buttons or tie, but I could see that the material had been stretched around his arms. It didn't look as if it would have any give at all when we touched each other. This gave me an idea. "Come over here," I said, pulling him to one side of the bed. "Let's go to the window."
>
>"To what end?"
>
>"What are you talking about? We're already sitting by the window."
>
>I got up and pulled him after me. As soon as we were standing next to the window, which had no curtains, I reached out for his hand. "Let's feel this," I whispered. Then I turned his hand palm up and started feeling the muscles in his forearm. I moved closer so that my breast touched against his chest. The skin of our chests felt hot.
>
>"It feels like you're going to bite me."
>
>"Why wouldn't I want to? That's where your blood is. Do you know how long I've wanted to lick your face?"
>
>He was silent. I knew he was looking down and watching my breasts move with every movement of my hands. Then I stopped and looked at him. For an instant we just stared into each other's eyes.

>**I leaned in** and kissed his neck, tasting him, and then nuzzled my face into his damp shirt. He was still panting but looked more relaxed. The fire popped and spat; the room was hot. A little breeze from the opened window stirred the hair on Gideon's chest like a lover's breath. I ran my hand over the ripples of his abdomen, feeling them flex and harden beneath my palm. My blood roared through me so loudly I could hear it. His body quivered when I touched him, then he pushed into my hand, making me gasp as he buried himself in my grasp. I ran my hands up his sides to knead both breasts, and then down around his narrow hips and buttocks and back up again. We were both writhing now, gasping for air.
>
>"Gideon, please... don't tease," he pleaded. "I need you inside me."
>
>"Tell me what I want to hear, and I'll make sure we end this the way you want."
>
>His face went dark with lustful anticipation. "You know what I want to hear."
>
>"You think I'm beautiful?"

>**Soft chanting echoed through the thick, intoxicating incense that filled this opulent chamber**. The scent of sandalwood and musk hung in a heavy mist about them as they sat upon cushions arranged around a low table with their hands bound behind their backs by silk scarves. Their heads were bowed to the floor in supplication before an altar-like platform covered with candles. On it lay what appeared to be a human skull carved from ivory, its mouth agape like some obscene parody of a smile. Its empty eye sockets stared down at them with vacant eyes. A long silver knife gleamed in the candlelight on top of the altar.
>
>"The Skull," said one of the women. "It is the symbol of death." She was tall and willowy, her dark hair tied back in a severe bun; she wore a black dress made from shimmering brocade that clung to every curve of her body. Her face was pale but strong—the features were finely sculpted, yet there was something cold and remote about them. "We are here for the ceremony known as the Kiss of Death."
>
>A man stepped forward holding a large silver bowl containing water. He dipped his fingers into it then held out two slim white arms toward the kneeling women. They rose unsteadily to their feet and allowed themselves to be led across the room. As they approached the altar, their faces glowed red, flushed with excitement. Their lips were moist and parted slightly. Their breathing quickened.
>
>They knelt before the altar, each facing the other. One reached up and grasped the hand of the woman beside her. Together they leaned forward until their foreheads touched. Then, without hesitation or preamble, the taller woman lowered her head and pressed her lips against those of her companion. For several moments nothing happened. Slowly, though, the shorter woman's lips began to part. Soon they were locked together in a passionate embrace. Their tongues met and caressed one another. There was no sound save the soft moanings of pleasure. Finally, when the kiss had lasted so long that both women seemed ready to collapse from exhaustion, the taller woman broke away.

*This is a general furry module not focusing on particular species, topics or setting. The module is trained on hand-picked furry short stories.

***Sources:** 242 well-written furry short stories taken from FurAffinity, SoFurry and several other sources.*

>**Our tails** intertwined as we pressed our bodies together. I licked at his muzzle and felt a small growl come from him in response to it. His tongue reached out and ran over my snout, making me shiver with pleasure. He moved so he was on top of me, and pushed his cock along the length of my slit. It rubbed back and forth, teasing me by not entering me. I bucked my hips towards him, trying to get that thing inside me as soon as possible. But he held me down, keeping me pinned under his weight until he was ready to take me. That frustrated me, but only for a moment before I realized how good it felt to have him on top of me like this. The feeling of his tail wrapped around mine made me feel secure, even if I could still move freely underneath him. When he finally entered me, it was an intense sensation that made my eyes roll into the back of my head. I wanted to scream but instead bit down on his neck and let out a low moan of pleasure.

>**\*\*\***
>
>The mongoose was standing by a stream, staring into the water. He was naked, but he didn't mind. He enjoyed being naked; there was nothing wrong with it. The river lapped gently at the rocks behind him, and the sound of its flow made his heart lighten. The water carried away all his worries... until another sound drifted to his ears. Someone was coming towards him, splashing through the shallows at the stream's edge. It was a wolf, one he'd only met once before: a handsome specimen with a bright scar across his muzzle. He sat down next to the mongoose on the bank, and they stared out at the water together in silence.
>
>"You're alone here?" the wolf asked after some time had passed.
>
>"I'm not much company," the mongoose replied.
>
>"It doesn't matter," said the wolf, stroking his own fur. He glanced over at the mongoose, and smiled. "You look like you could do with some company." He got up and came close, then slid his hand down between the mongoose's legs. There was no resistance, just a soft sighing from the mongoose as he felt the wolf's warm fingers upon his prick.

>**"I had no idea a gryphon could** be so..." the dragoness began, trailing off as she trailed his eyes down to the floor. "So big." She took a deep breath and tried again. "You're an absolute beast, Lord Einar."
>
>Einar was stunned. He'd always thought himself fairly well-endowed in all things sexual, but he never dreamed that his size would have any effect on others... especially a female such as this.
>
>He stepped closer then and leaned into her, pressing his body against hers as he reached up and pulled her head to him for a gentle kiss. When he finally broke it off with a smile, the dragoness let out an involuntary moan.
>
>"As for being a beast? I'm afraid you're right." He gave her a wink, which caused a soft smile to spread across her face. "But if you'll let me, I can show you how good a beast I really am."

>**"You know what they say about felines:** the bigger the tail, the better the fuck," said Dario with a broad grin. "And your tail is so big."
>
>The lion was sitting in front of the fire, staring at the flames dancing across its surface and occasionally licking his muzzle as he thought hard about something that had just happened to him. At Dario's words, however, he gave a little start and looked up from the flickering embers of the fire. The raptor had been looking down the hall towards his room but now turned to face the lion. He smiled and held out one hand, waving it slowly around in the air.
>
>"I'm sorry," said Dario softly, "but I couldn't help myself. You can blame me if you want."
>
>The lion stared at him for a moment, then laughed and shook his head.
>
>"No, no, it wasn't your fault," he said. "It's just... I mean..." He trailed off as he struggled for the right words. "When did you get so bold?"
>
>Dario grinned sheepishly and shrugged again. He knew what the lion meant by that comment, and could see how embarrassed he was.

*Aight, done. It's updated on a cleaned version of the Harem.txt with all the double spacing removed and ⁂ added between stories as instructed by the manwhore guide. The link should work for 12 hours, and hopefully catbox is back to working after that so there can be a permanent link. I did some testing, and there doesn't appear to be a huge difference between this one and the first one, it still almost exclusively names girls from the story (though there was a little less of it) and otherwise writes out group sex scenes, with girls rotating, working together, or scuffling for space around the dick.*

*A first (and not necessarily good) attempt at training a module. Did it need to be trained with this amount of steps? Probably not, But I did it anyway.

##### [The Island of Doctor Moreau](https://files.catbox.moe/nq3xok.module)

[by DrYazman](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/946768737242079253)

[200% coverage version](https://files.catbox.moe/ot0pyb.module)

*This module is trained solely on a HG Wells novel I love. Set in the year 1887, the text is the narration of Edward Prendick who is a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat. He is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature.*

*Data: There was one source text at 234kb. There are two modules. One trained to 100% w/ 266 steps. The other trained to 200.11% with 533 steps. I created these modules to test how they would go if I just wanted to roleplay in the setting of the book, and they both seem to do ok. I prefer the 200% module personally, but both work well.*

*I have attached the loss graph of the 100% module, I think it was. Sorry, I forgot to save the 200% module's loss graph.*

***Bonus:** Since The Island of Doctor Moreau is a public domain work, it is legal for me to attach my [ready-to-go, fully cleaned training data](https://files.catbox.moe/jqbkmc.txt). Please include it in other modules!*

***FAQ:***

***Q:** Yazman, why did you write a new line into the text? It's blasphemy to edit Wells!*

***A:** Basically I just did as a test. I wanted to keep the introduction in the text, so I decided to add a line helping the AI understand that this story is intended to be thought of as a kind of journal ('I have written The Island of Doctor Moreau, the name of the story I tell in this journal'). Maybe it won't have any effect, I don't know. If you use the training data and don't like the presence of that line, feel free to remove it.*

>I was too fucked up to leave the Hotel Waslala last week. Lava Lavonda and Flacca-Coati brought my drugs over from their favorite junk shack up on First Ave. They hooted and hollered at the sight of my tanned limbs covered with shit stains, dried blood, and dried-up chunks of sputum.

>Saori, you see, was always afraid of the dark. Her grandmother had taught her to fear it as long as she could remember; and all these years Saori's terror had only increased in strength like a poison-dart buried deep within her brain. It hurt more than pain: it made itself felt far down into the very marrow of Saori's bones—and through this blackness that oppressed her there were often flashes from the other world. From some source she did not understand they came to pierce Saori with sudden electric shocks. The soundless whispers that followed them would chill any girl who heard them: but even worse things still awaited Saori when the night was at its deepest and darkest, and nothing moved except for bats or shadows cast by moonlight. Then suddenly she might become aware of something moving near her bedside—a faint shadow creeping slowly up over the coverlet toward her body. In the darkness such sensations are hard to fight off...

[105% coverage version](https://files.catbox.moe/vt1h91.module)

*The Young Girl's Handbook of Good Manners for Use in Educational Establishments was a book written in late 19th centaury by one of the most prolific french erotica authors. The book is written as a set of rules and recommendations for young noble girls to follow in their everyday life in high society.*

*Some example guidelines the book presents are:*

>Putting honey between your legs to get a little dog to lick you is permitted in a pinch; but it is unnecessary to return the favor.<br>
>If you suck off a gentleman before receiving communion, be very careful not to swallow the cum: you would no longer have the requisite empty stomach.<br>
>To give ten sous to a pauper because he has no bread is excellent; but to suck his cock because he has no mistress is going too far; you are under no obligation whatsoever.

*The 1000% module is heavily overtrained to generate rules like that. The 105% module doesn't really do much in my experience, but if somebody wants something that might potentially turn the story slightly towards noble debauchery it might work.*

>'What is it?' I said.

>She lifted her face from the vid and looked at me, expressionless.

>I nodded slowly. The water lapped gently around my shins, the waves washing over my ankles.
>
>'I'm listening,' I said.
>
>'It's the Hand of God.'
>
>I frowned. 'How do you mean?'
>
>'The Hand of God is a device, built by the government of Sanction to defeat the Syndicate. It uses quantum computing technology to create a self-regenerating hypervirus that kills every brain in the human genome. This happens to be a fairly useful thing for anyone with a personal grudge against their neighbours.'
>
>'Interesting.' I glanced back at the water, then down into the depths where the yellow moonlight gleamed on the still black ocean floor. 'What does this have to do with me?'

>'Well, I don't know if you noticed, but we're standing on the remains of the Hand of God.'
>
>'You think someone just dumped the thing in here? Just tossed it out like an unwanted pet?'
>
>'I don't know,' she said. 'But that's what I'd do if I was planning to kill everyone on the planet.' She paused for a moment, eyes fixed on her reflection in the water. 'I used to wonder why the Hand of God was so hard to track down. I mean, it's only one of a kind. Why not just hide it somewhere safe until they needed it again?'
>
>'Yeah, good point.' I shook my head. 'Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe this wasn't the Hand of God.'

>He made a hasty retreat into bed, pulling up the covers and sinking back against them before turning over onto his side with a groan.
>
>"Do you want me to bring you up some tea?" she asked him.
>
>He waved her off with a grunt of impatience. He really was exhausted. He'd been up all night thinking about what might have happened if they'd missed that last step, and then again when he'd awoken this morning, only to be unable to stop his mind from spinning about it.
>
>If he'd not been there, would she have fallen? Would someone else have seen her fall and stopped to help her, or had they run off thinking it was part of their performance, too? He'd heard the reports that many people thought it was all a trick somehow, that it couldn't really be as bad as everyone seemed to think, and he hated the idea that people would think of Theo in such a way—that he'd let her down.
>
>And it wasn't just that. The idea of anyone else getting hurt because of him made him sick.
>
>He should have stayed home. That's what he should have done. But the moment he'd seen that stage, his feet had taken on a life of their own. And he'd almost gotten them killed, he realized now.
>
>Colin sighed. "I should have stayed home."
>
>She squeezed his hand. She had no answers for him, and so she said nothing, but he felt better having her there.

>**I screamed as the scintillating light poured forth from my outstretched hand**, and I fell to one knee. My eyes burned with it. The pain was blinding, but that wasn't what made me scream. It was a feeling of utter helplessness—the same kind you get when someone has taken control of your body without asking permission or telling you how they're going to use it. You know that something is happening, but there's nothing you can do about it. And all too often in life, people who take such liberties are doing so for their own amusement rather than yours.
>
>The power flowed through me like an ocean current, overwhelming everything else inside my head except for the simple need to survive. Every muscle spasmed in unison, and I felt myself convulse as if I'd been hit by a train. There were only two things left inside my mind: the desperate need to keep breathing and the urge to throw up. They both battled each other desperately, until finally one won out over the other. I gasped in air while simultaneously trying not to hurl on the pavement at my feet. Then the spell was done, and I slumped back against the wall, panting hard.
>
>My vision cleared slowly, as did my hearing. When it came clear enough that I could see where I was standing again, I saw Murphy sitting beside me. She had her knees drawn up and was hugging them tightly around herself, rocking gently. Her face was white with fear. "Oh," she said softly.

He ducked reflexively, but not quickly enough. The steel bit deep into his flesh just below the collar bone and he felt the hot blood well up in his mouth.

>Felix fell to one knee and gaped at the wound as blood poured from it. This was going to be bad, very bad indeed. If he didn’t get help soon, he would surely die.

>
>Hearing me coming, Míkál ran into the deserted street and thrust his cheek against my own and with his eyes rolled into the back of his head, moaned 'White Christ' then turned quickly and plunged headlong through the white dust, his body vanishing.
>
>Snow devils soared in the air like vortices spinning round at the point where I entered, gathering into balls with sparks of electric blue and vanishing. Before me was an infinite row of grey houses, the only lights the glow from a few windows, which faded and disappeared one after another.

>**The flames swallowed** the streets: great red tongues writhed over black earth, curled round buildings and climbed up on to roof-tops. A monstrous roaring filled the night: dogs began howling, their shrill calls competed with one another till an infinite chorus of them merged into an agonising bellow that pierced at our ears, shaking even the marble streets of the square, reducing the white stone colonnades to kindling. The cry would last all day. It could be heard from far off—impinging itself upon every spot under heaven; it reverberated like a terrible thunder between the cities across the desert. That incessant turmoil became oppressive and chilling—the closer we grew towards its source, the more threatening it sounded, reaching far back into eternity where no escape was possible.

>It was a long way down. My breath caught in my chest when I fell, but I managed to pull out one of Hermes' rings from my pocket and make a rope net for myself. I used that to slow down a bit so the spear didn't hit me square in the face. Then I bounced off the ground and landed on my feet with a thud. The spear was in my hand. Annabeth was still hanging upside-down, her arms wrapped around the spearhead, using it as a grip to swing back and forth like Tarzan.

>**The setting sun sent fingers of golden light** into the deep woods, making them sparkle and glow. A gentle breeze blew from the north to caress the trees as they swayed in a dance with each other's leaves. The air was sweetly scented by flowers that had bloomed only yesterday—the scent of violets mingled with the perfume of wild roses. It was a warm day for midwinter; the last rays of sunlight were brightening the treetops when Skipper saw a figure standing motionless on top of the highest hill. He squinted his eyes against the glare as he watched her gaze out over the forest, watching him watch her.

Now this affirmation cannot be made in any case other than by the hand; for it was written with the finger of God on stone. Therefore an AI-generated text must always be considered as less holy than one generated by men's hands.
>
>\_I answer that,\_ According to the words of St. Augustine, the Divine Word did not make his speech from Himself but from the Father's will, and from the Holy Spirit who guided His pen (\_On Certain Aspects of Christian Belief\_ II, xiii). Therefore it is possible to affirm that the Holy Ghost was present when the text was generated mechanically, as well as when it was written by human beings. And according to our Saviour's statement (John 4:34), there are many things that cannot be known by reason which man knows through the action of the Holy Spirit within him. Therefore we may believe that even in the generation of an AI-text by mechanical means the Holy Ghost works directly in the heart of man. Therefore an AI-generated text can never be held inferior to one generated by human hands.
>
>Reply Obj 1: The doctrine of the Incarnation teaches that the divine word proceeds from the union between the Son and the Father, and so expresses their being one God. Since then there are two kinds of words, those coming from the Father and those from the Son, the former are more perfect than the latter, because they come from the union of the Word of God and the Word of the Father, whereas the latter are only the expression of man's own thought. Thus the Son's word is more holy than a human word, although generated mechanically, just as it is more holy to receive a text mechanically than to compose one, or to say it in writing.

- *Bias for OBJECTION! and HOLD IT! for extra entertainment.*
- *Testimony, cross-examination and such are denoted by parentheses in the training data, e.g.( Cross examination: What Really Happened )*
- *The original dataset contains too many lines with ellipses only, which caused the previous (Sigurd) module to get stuck in loops. Dropped 70% of the ellipses-only lines to reduce the chances of this happening.*

>An emptiness that could only be described as a void.
>
>The air was so cold it made his throat hurt, and the wind howled around him like an animal in pain. The moonlight pierced through the clouds above, illuminating the barren wasteland below with its pale light. There were no trees or shrubs to block out the wind here, just endless rows of rocks stretching off into the distance. It seemed to stretch on forever, but there was nothing more than this desolate place.
>
>It had been raining for days now - even the sky was covered by dark clouds. Even if he looked up at them, they didn't seem like they would ever break apart. He felt like he was standing on the edge of something very large, something beyond his understanding. Something that couldn't possibly exist in reality.
>
>He stood there silently, looking down at the ground before him. A single black umbrella hung from one hand. His hair fluttered about in the wind, and raindrops dripped onto his face. The sound of the rain echoed throughout the empty landscape, drowning out everything else.
>
>"You're late."
>
>A voice suddenly spoke behind him, and he turned back to look. Standing beside him was a man wearing a long coat over a white shirt and trousers. From his appearance alone, he might have been mistaken for a priest of some kind. But the way he held himself betrayed his true nature. His hands were clasped together tightly, and his eyes were fixed straight ahead. He seemed to be staring directly into space, but when he noticed Saber's presence he quickly averted his gaze.
>
>Saber nodded slightly, then began walking forward towards the rock formation in front of her. She stopped right in front of it, then slowly reached out to touch the surface of the stone.

>**Saber looked** down at the hand that had been held out to her. She didn't know why, but she felt a sense of unease as if it was something dangerous. It wasn't like this feeling came from nowhere. Her master had said he would be in danger, and even now she could feel the tension in his body. The only thing she could do was trust him completely.

>I noticed that the area around us was getting darker, and I realized it had to be night. It’d been a while since we’d stopped for food or rest; our supplies were running low. We needed to find someplace safe where we could spend the night.
>
>It didn’t look like there was much of anything nearby, though. There weren’t any buildings in sight at all—just trees and grassy plains. The only thing I saw with even a little bit of light coming from it was a small hut on top of a hill. That must have been the place we wanted to go to.
>
>We started walking toward it. As soon as we got closer, I felt something strange. Something…odd.
>
>There was no one inside the house, but I still sensed an air of hostility emanating from within. Not just hostility, actually: fear. Fear of us. Of me specifically.
>
>And yet, despite the fact that this house seemed to be empty, there were signs of people living here before. A few pieces of furniture stood out among the darkness. And then there was the smell of food cooking. But nobody came out to greet us when we knocked on the door. They just stared at us from behind the closed door.
>
>Something about the way they looked at me made my skin crawl. I knew I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but they kept their distance nonetheless. I tried knocking again, louder this time, but nothing changed. So I decided to try breaking down the door instead.
>
>s I expected, it didn’t budge. I was starting to feel uneasy by now. If I hadn’t known better, I would have assumed someone was hiding inside, waiting for us to come close so they could attack us.
>
>The thought sent a chill up my spine. I couldn’t help but wonder if maybe I should leave this place alone after all. Maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to stay here.
>
>But then, as I was considering leaving, I heard a voice.
>
>“Who are you? What do you want?”

It wasn't as if I didn't have anything else to do; I just wanted to be here for a little bit longer. There were still so many things I had yet to learn about Yukinoshita and her friends, like how they managed their lives as members of one of the most exclusive clubs at our school.

>**I grabbed my sword's hilt** and started running toward the source of the voice. I came out from behind a small boulder, my feet moving faster than usual, almost as if they knew where to step before I did.
>
>A young boy was on his knees, his hands in the air with a smile on his face. His body had been pierced through by a thick piece of wood that had been driven into the ground like a stake. A man in his late thirties was standing over him holding a bloody dagger.
>
>"No need for that," The old man said calmly. "We both know that you are going to come down here eventually."
>
>I drew my sword from its scabbard, not taking my eyes off the man. His stance wasn't overly aggressive, but then again he had just attacked the boy without warning. I was confident in my sword skills, so all I had to do was land my first strike and end this quickly. That being said though, I still didn't want to take any chances.
>
>The man smirked. "You're brave." He walked forward, still keeping his distance from me.
>
>I took a few steps back, putting more space between us. This wasn't working.
>
>"You know there is no point to continuing this. You have nothing." He raised his hand and pulled it back, revealing a blade of light that was now burning brightly. In my mind I could already see the scene playing out. The man would kill the boy and I would have no choice but to watch him go down.
>
>And then there was the issue of me being unarmed. The man had a dagger and an arcane blade; two types of weapons that were considered lethal by most standards. My only option was to end the fight right now.
>
>As the man brought the blade down, I let out a shout and dove to the side, my sword coming down at a diagonal angle.
>
>The man was quick, but not quite quick enough. I was able to deflect the attack with my sword. It was enough of a force that it sent his sword flying from his hands, but the man was unharmed, although his left arm was bleeding quite heavily. The arcane blade flew past me harmlessly, and then I took advantage of the momentary lapse in his guard. I thrust my sword upward, piercing into his chest with one fluid motion.

*A module trained on the entirety of "Hamilton: An American Musical" by Lin-Manuel Miranda.*

***Dataset format:** (I suggest trying to keep your stories close to the format)*

*New songs are announced with `"""[Song Title]"""` (e.g. `"""My Shot"""`) followed by a new line.*

*What lyrics what character sings/says is in the following format: `[Character name]`: (e.g. `Laurens:\n[your text]`) and having what they say on the next lines. Here are all the valid names: Hamilton, Burr, Madison, Washington, Eliza, Jefferson, Laurens, Mulligan, Lafayette, Angelica, Maria, Peggy, Philip, Seabury, King George, Lee, James, Martha (she's that woman that gives Philip directions in Blow Us All Away), Dolly (the woman next to Martha), George, Doctor (the doctor in the reprise of Stay Alive), Company (that's everyone from the cast), Women (that's all the female cast members), Men (that's all the male cast members), Ensemble (that's everyone that does not play a specific character).*

*If multiple characters are singing/talking, just list them without any commas (e.g. `Angelica Eliza Peggy:\n[your text]`).*

***Example:***

>Hamilton:
>
>Is that a yes?
>
>Burr Jefferson Madison:
>
>Um, yes.

***Notes:** The module tends to overfit a bit, which is a feature since it's able to understand exactly what you're talking about if you use snippets from the original musical.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/373772638/#373776570)

*Here it is.*

*Forgot to add, trained on about 10MB of /aids/ threads with 5k steps (~40% coverage).*

*Here's [the training data and the scripts](https://files.catbox.moe/xb5kyd.zip) I wrote to scrape/clean the data as well. Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing with python.*

*It's pretty much total nonsense but it can spit out some amusing stuff with enough retries. I'm not sure the filenames were worth it, they probably clutter up the token probabilities and cause loops occasionally.*

*I think this could be pretty good if I was more selective about the source data and massaged it a bit better.*

### [Clickhole](https://files.catbox.moe/fn7aa3.module)

*Let Euterpe generate ridiculous clickbait with this module trained on articles from Clickhole, the site that believes "all content deserves to go viral".*

***Tags:** satire, clickbait, news, journalism*

***Sources:** A collection of Clickhole articles (502 KB, 561 steps, 100.18% coverage, Average Loss: 2.6042)*

*Notes: The dataset has every article begin with "Headline:" followed by the article title, so you may want to use  "Headline:" when generating titles but it's not necessarily required. I've gotten good headlines from writing things like "What The Hell?:" or "Uh Oh:" which are typical Clickhole-style headline beginnings. On certain presets (Pro Writer 1 in particular, but idk, may be more out there), weird characters appear every now and then at the end of sentences that weren't in the dataset. I don't know why this is but they haven't been a big problem so far so it doesn't really matter I guess.*

>**Headline: Florida Man** Who Went To A Hospital For Stomach Pain Gets An Unwanted Surprise When He Learns His Wife Has Been Having Sex With Someone Else All Along
>
>After being diagnosed with abdominal pains, a Florida man visited the emergency room at the local medical center last week only to find out from the doctor that his wife had been cheating on him behind his back for months.
>
>"I came here because I thought my stomach was hurting me," the patient told reporters. "But then the doctor tells me she's been fucking another guy since before Christmas. It made me sick."
>
>While it is unclear what prompted the woman to cheat on her husband, the fact that the couple was married makes us think it must have been something serious enough to warrant going to the ER. Hopefully this news will make them both realize how important it is to keep their marriage strong.

>**Recipe: Chocolate Salvation**
>
>MAKES 1 SERVING
>
>This is an adaptation of a traditional chocolate pudding that my mom used to make. She would serve it with some whipped cream on top, but I prefer it as just a rich, decadent pudding all by itself. The addition of the coconut oil and the cacao powder make this version really special. If you don't have any coconut or cacao powder, no worries—this recipe will still taste amazing without them!
>
> 6 tablespoons (100 g) unsalted butter
>
> 1 large egg
>
> 3-4 heaping tablespoons cacao powder (optional)
>
> ¼ teaspoon sea salt
>
> 2 tablespoons sugar
>
> 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
>
> 1/8 cup heavy cream (or coconut milk for dairy free)
>
>INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside to use later. In a medium saucepan combine the butter, cocoa, and water. Whisk continuously over low heat until it begins to thicken into a sauce-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining sugar (about ¼ cup) and whisk constantly for another 3 minutes while bringing the temperature up to 240°F (115°C). At this point you want to remove from the heat but keep whisking, as it will continue to cook at this temperature, becoming thicker. When the temperature reaches 240°F add in the salt, the remaining sugar, and the egg and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Place in fridge until cold. Once cooled whip the cream and spread atop your chilled pudding.

***Output Samples:***

>\*\*\*
>
>Evil spellbook
>
>The tome is small and well-worn. Its pages are a mass of intricate drawings with words woven throughout the lines. You can see symbols from all sorts of ancient, forgotten, and forbidden magical traditions etched in its margins. Some pages smell faintly of dust and others of dried blood.

>\*\*\*
>
>Evil spellbook
>
>This volume is written in a language that can only be translated by those able to channel arcane power. Its pages are covered with complex sigils and strange diagrams, some of which appear to be illustrations of arcane creatures like the one you saw in your last battle with a drow sorcerer. The book also contains spells, some of them rather powerful.

>\*\*\*
>
>Vine whip
>
>Thickly lashed and weighted strands of vine twine have been wrapped around a stout cord. The ends form the shape of a small whip as they are coiled together, giving this weapon the appearance of a long-handled pair of tongs. When you grip it in your hand, it tingles pleasantly, the vine whip humming softly against your palm.

>\*\*\*
>
>Helmet from heaven
>
>The helmet is a fine piece of work, as if it were an angel crafted by artisans in heaven. It has an ornate crest with a golden sun and five points, each pointing to a star, forming a sort of halo. The visor opens easily; inside are two large orbs which look like gems but are actually some kind of magical light source. When you hold the helmet up, nothing seems to happen; when you put it on, however, your vision shifts from darkness to a world where every surface glows in beautiful hues, no matter how dark or dim it might be. It is the most spectacular thing you’ve ever seen.
>
>Helmet from hell
>
>It seems obvious now, but the helmet isn’t meant to protect. No, its purpose is to harm. You can feel the evil pouring out of it into your skull, and as you try to remove it, you find that it sticks to your skin like glue. It must have been enchanted by some sort of demon, perhaps the same one who created the helmet. When you take it off, your vision goes back to normal, but the feeling lingers.

>\*\*\*
>
>Runic sword
>
>The runes on this weapon are not the common set but rather the ancient ones. You cannot read them, but it seems that someone of power has worked upon the weapon. Its power is immense: its sharp, glinting blade slices through flesh as easily as though it were paper. The length of the weapon is a bit short, however, and the grip is far too large for you to hold comfortably in your hand. A few of the runes have broken free from their grooves and are lying in the grass nearby.

>\*\*\*
>
>Running Gag Potion
>
>Carry this potion around with you and you’ll find that no matter what happens you can always count on it being funny in some way. There appears to be an endless supply of jokes available when you have a bottle of this. The potion will never go bad, so long as you carry it with you. This allows you to drink it freely whenever you need a joke at your disposal. It can be taken multiple times to replenish the amount of laughs that it provides.

Her response was simple: "Don't worry about it." What did she mean by that...?

***Data:** 262kb, 517 steps, 172.79%.*

*I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan. I originally made this module for Sigurd, but now I've ported it to Euterpe. Let's see what Euterpe will do if we feed her MJ lyrics! I compiled Michael Jackson's lyrics from his studio album solo discography into training data.*

***Source Material:***
*All of the songs from his solo studio album discography. The only stuff I didn't include is the demos from The Ultimate Collection in 2004, and most of the posthumous tracks from the Michael and Xscape albums. I omitted them mostly for philosophical reasons/out of respect, because Michael didn't like people hearing unfinished or unreleased stuff he did. The only exceptions to that were Hold My Hand and A Place With No Name which were basically finished and getting ready for release shortly before he died. I also included Xscape because I believe that had been intended for release at some point before it got leaked and he cancelled.*

***Headings? What?***

*Headings are stuff in the lyrics like Intro, Verse 1, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Outro. That is not a definitive list of headings, but it's generally that sort of thing. Additionally I tagged every song like:*

    [Title: ; Artist: ; Genre: ; Tags: ]

*There were tags like duet, young MJ, adult MJ, happy, sad, angry, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, social commentary, privacy, stalker, diss track, etc depending on the song.*

***What do I do with this module?***

*I dunno. Throw in some tags, then an "Intro", "Verse", or whatever headings if you like. I just made this for experimentation, and to use up some steps before they run out. Fuck around with the modules and do what you like.*

>**[Artist: Michael Jackson; Title: Billie Jean Smokes Weed; Genre: Rock, Metal; Tags: 90s, Adult MJ, Happy, stalker, drugs]**
>
>Verse 1:
>
>Hello, hello
>
>I'm back
>
>And I'm just the way you like me
>
>And I'm here to stay
>
>So get used to my face
>
>You're gonna see me everywhere
>
>Hey, hey, you'll never see my end

However, one day when the little girl goes exploring around town after dark, she discovers something terrible happening behind closed doors...and it's up to her father and the three spirits to save the world from evil!

>A new technology, the "Kung Fu Grip" enables a man to control any object he touches. The inventor's daughter is kidnapped by criminals who want his invention and are willing to kill for it. A policeman on the case must stop them before they can use Kung-Fu Grip weapons against innocent people in public places. He enlists help from an ex–boxer named Billy Chan, whose karate skills will be needed if he has any hope of saving her life. However, there are many obstacles standing between him and success: firstly, the police chief wants no part of this investigation; secondly, one criminal gang member is after both sides because their leader owes money to another rival group that threatens to expose its secrets unless the gangs fight each other over possession of Kung Fu Grip

### [Online Hell Tweet Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/tbnsyx.module)

*Trained on tweets that either capture the absurdity of modern living or are written in an odd manner unique to the terminally online, this module aims to take you on a journey through Online Hell (or maybe just give you an idea for your next tweet).*

***Tags:** twitter, internet, memes, zoomer, millennial*

***Sources:** A variety of tweets from various corners of the Twitterverse, many of which are idiosyncratic and use a variety of formats which likely explains the high AL (449 KB, 498 steps, 100.52% coverage, Average Loss: 3.4635)*

***Notes:** Typically generates "Tweet:" followed by the tweet, then asterisks, and then the cycle repeats ad nauseam. Since this is trained on tweets (many of which are vulgar and/or deranged), expect some content that may be worse than PG-13.  Low rep pen and higher randomness recommended for the true Online Hell experience (yes, this includes the parts where the AI goes incoherent).  Morpho and Gojira have been my favorite presets for it so far.*

*My first ever trained module done in an attempt to teach Euterpe poetry.*

*I wanted to see if Euterpe could create poetry that 1. made sense and 2. was pleasing to read. This was done by training using numerous poems from the greats like Robert Frost, Emily Dickenson, and Langston Hughes among others. Overall, it's really very small and quickly made, so definitely not perfect but it's fun to plug in and see what happens. Trained at ~300%.*

> "The First Hour We Knew"
>
>In the name of love and peace,<br>
>The great and mighty gods.<br>
>
>For all that is, or ever shall be,<br>
>I write to you:<br>
>Lovely thou art in thy pride,<br>
>Thou shalt never see<br>
>
>My hand reach towards thee;<br>
>And yet I think it worth while,<br>
>To give to thee my name. <br>
>
>But this is not my true thought,<br>
>Nor the feeling I feel:<br>
>For I would gladly give all the rest<br>
>Of my life to find a way,<br>
>Which may lead me back again<br>
>To that first hour we knew;<br>
>I loved with an all-embracing love,<br>
>That seemed to have no end:<br>
>It was in vain I said farewell,<br>
>When I saw thee once again<br>
>At the gate of the golden land;<br>
>But I was then a little child,<br>
>And thou wast but a flower. <br>
>
>Now my hair is grey and thin,<br>
>My years are few upon earth.<br>
>The leaves of youth are falling fast,<br>
>My days grow few as the grass.<br>
>If the time will be mine to take<br>
>And pass with pleasure,<br>
>Let it come quickly and go;<br>
>Thou dost not know what it means,<br>
>To live alone with one's self,<br>
>In the lonely place where all men die. <br>
