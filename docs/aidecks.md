## The fuck is it?

At the end of each month, I set up an anchor for 24 hours to collect suggestions on SETTINGS. After that, I hold a 24-hour vote, and whoever wins becomes the setting for the following month.

The submission anchor appears on Sundays of each alternate week (from Theme Friday submission collection), tracking what was previously posted so you know the deck is developing!

### What is a setting?

I'm running with "The time, place, and/or circumstances in which a narrative can take place". This means that suggestions can be anything from "World where WW2 never happened" to "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni". So long as it can be understood as a defined setting, it should be a good fit.

### Are there any requirements for the cards themselves?

Keep the prose flowing and make each card as self-contained as possible, those are my two main requests. If you're going to make a multi-entry singular card that stacks bracketed information throughout context with innumerable phrase biases, you should reconsider your idea. Keep it as simple as possible.
Aside from that, you're good as long as it passes the "this is a thing that believably exists in this setting" test.

### How abstract can we go?

You can be as abstract as you want, but I'd assume that for cards that implement things like viruses, conditions, states of being, or other less concrete ideas, you'd make additional cards that use those things. Hey, maybe you'll get lucky and other anons will like your idea so much that they'll make cards that with it anyway!
### Where will the decks be stored?

Here, silly!

### Is any of this subject to change?

Probably! This is a brand new event after all. If something isn't working, be sure to let me know.

## **The Nightmare Realm**
{: .center}

(August 2022)
{: .center}

*In the beginning, there was nothing. The void. A blackness so pure as to defy even the mightiest of storms. Then, suddenly, there was light. And then it came into being. Creation—the earth and sea and sky. But from its birthplace, outside that ocean sea, madness poured forth in hallucinogenic waves drowning all others torn apart by the terror of their own minds. The cataclysm began, a ripple of insanity turning all but the strongest mad.*
{: .center}

*That is this place. This realm. It is not truly a realm at all, but rather an open wound where madness and chaos pour out onto the world. Here one may see the true face of hell, the wretched things of nightmares.*
{: .center}

### **The Visitors**

## **Agency for Investigation and Detainment of the Supernatural**
{: .center}

*Strange beings lurk in the shadows, unknown to the general public. A secret network of operatives known as AIDS (Agency for Investigation and Detainment of the Supernatural) studies and catalogues these many paranormal phenomena. It doesn't matter whether it's ghosts, vampires or aliens, the agency will handle them all—the truth is out there.*
{: .center}

*The suit and tie is optional.*
{: .center}

### **The Paranormal**
{: .center}

*Spooky monsters and scary cryptids.*

## **Heists**
{: .center}

(May 2022)
{: .center}

![](https://files.catbox.moe/vwtlhi.png)
{: .center}

*It's a perfect format for decks, make cards about the crew, the masterminds, the target loot, the crazy places to be broken into, it goes on.*<br>
*And don't limit yourself strictly to formats like Ocean's 11, although personally that will be my focus, but any sort of organized planned robbery like bank jobs, knocking over a train, can work if you play your cards right.*

![/aids/ Starship Exploration Vessel](https://files.catbox.moe/2ix8xc.png)
{: .center}

*Space... The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of starship /aids/. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new worlds. To seek out new waifus and husbandos. To boldly cum where no man has cum before!*
{: .center}

*The possibilities are limitless, both for the members of the crew and the places they go. It can also be played as lewd or clean as you want; the worlds the ship visits can be anything from a hyper-sexualized resort world to boldly taking landing parties down to explore ancient ruins on a dead world.*

### **The Ship**

| Card | Name | Description | Post |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Card](https://files.catbox.moe/cfek2z.png) | VT-23 Kestrel | Alright, some of you might have seen me spit out this trash a couple threads ago. Unfortunately I couldn't refine it since then since I've been without internet for the past several days, but without further ado here's my rough draft of the Kestral, an aging light transport that takes heavy inspiration from Firefly.<br>I haven't been able to test it much, but what I've had so far is promising; the AI understands the rough dimensions of the ship, that it's old and holding together on a prayer, and it seems to be able to easily get the cozy, tight-knight crew atmosphere I was going for. As this is my first card, I welcome any and all feedback that you all have (and, if you just want me to stop posting this thing, this is the last time unless I make an updated version).<br>But what's a ship without a crew to live on it? Because of my aforementioned no Internet issue I haven't been able to do as much on the crew as I'd like, but you have my word they'll be done by the 28th of February. First should be a two-for-one muscular catgirl duo, with an older human captain right on their heels. If anyone has any requests, let me know and I'll see if my limited skills can accommodate you. | [>>372381010](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/372230097/#372381010) |
